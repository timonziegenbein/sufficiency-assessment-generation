ESSAY	ARGUMENT	TEXT	ANNOTATION1	1	First of all , through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students . What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others . During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred . All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life . 	1	2	On the other hand , the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory . Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition . 	insufficient2	1	Firstly , maintaining one ‰Ûª s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ‰Ûª s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	insufficient2	2	Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ‰Ûª s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	3	1	Firstly , international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country ‰Ûª s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists . Take Cambodia for example , a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants , hotels , souvenir shops and other stores . These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard . Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country . 	insufficient3	2	Secondly , through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected . For instance , in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely ‰Û÷ Trong Dong ‰Ûª drum performance and ‰Û÷ Ha Long ‰Ûª bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry . Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works . Thus , tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes . 	insufficient4	1	Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations . Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits . This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism . Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries . 	insufficient4	2	Secondly , there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals . As the Australia ' s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat ‰Ûª s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions . For this reason , many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species . Thus , it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments . 	insufficient5	1	First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures . Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life . 	5	2	Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet . One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life . Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else . 	5	3	Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills . Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market . Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers . 	6	1	First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	6	2	One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	6	3	Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . Learning about others ' cultures is so important . It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	7	1	First of all , to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers . Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime . As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages . Hence , the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information . 	7	2	Another point is that , from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one . It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries . The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so . For this reason , the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time . 	7	3	Last , but not least , when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down . This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today . At this point , newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive . 	8	1	Concerning that elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society , government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it . So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development . In other words , if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education . 	8	2	That ' s not enough , for higher education , which represent the cutting edge of a country ' s academic achievements , act as the vanguard in economic and social advance . The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community . Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention , but this argument is invalid . Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money , what ' s more , government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide . 	9	1	Consideration is always important in relationship . For example , roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time . Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine . At all times , think about the other ' s feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously . Therefore , having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life . It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member . 	insufficient9	2	Moreover , communication is as well making a good roommate . People have different habit in daily life , such as tidy the blanket in the morning . One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project . If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk . Therefore , communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation . Through communication , bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others . 	10	1	First and foremost , carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere . The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged . If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work . This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment . Whereas , if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released . Obviously , the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth . 	10	2	In addition , the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam . It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities . The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads . In order to tackle the problem , governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes . There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion . 	11	1	"First of all , the ancient Latin proverb says : "" Anima sana in corpore sano "" , which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul . There is a direct linkage between people ' s health and the frequency of doing physical exercises . The more we practice , the better we feel . Additionally , there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity : gradually , step by step we change physical condition to better . So , if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation . "	11	2	Besides , when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer . For example , when a person goes jogging everyday , eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation . Alike , the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically . Furthermore , almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation , which is a part of physical education . 	insufficient11	3	Last , but not least , financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is . For instance , the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare , since the nation is comparatively healthy . Along with that , physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development . As a matter of fact , the better a person feels , the better his brain works . Therefore , putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society . As hence it ends up with financially competitive country . 	12	1	First and foremost , email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology . Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered . But nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not . 	12	2	Another important aspect on technology is transferring money . Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before . Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online . Therefore , with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily . 	insufficient12	3	Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments . Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world . For example , one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries . In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement . But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily . 	insufficient13	1	First , technology inspires children to create new things . Children are curious about everything around them , so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works . For example , Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer , then he did everything he could to understand how it worked . After he had figured out all the stuff , he then began to promote the computer . In the end , he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight . Therefore , instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create . 	insufficient13	2	Second , technology widen children ' s knowledge . In the past , children were only able to see things from one perspective . However , with highly advanced technology , children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends . Therefore , they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking . Knowledge is the base of creativity . The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things . 	14	1	Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	14	2	Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . In this case , students learn things easily . Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . 	insufficient15	1	First of all , it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity . Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones . Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information . However , email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above . People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want . Especially , thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging ( SMS ) , it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information , even to many people at the same time . They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways . 	15	2	The popularity of email and text messaging , as a result , leads to the losing of written language ' s position . People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities . The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form . Even in some cases , people compose a message with only emoticons ( the expressions by face created by service providers ) , which means there is no room for writing or typing texts . Moreover , it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying , writing assignments . If that tendency continues at a rapid pace , written language may face up to a real problem about its stand . 	16	1	First of all , as we all know , animals are friendly and vital for people , because if there are no animals in the world , the balance of nature will broke down , and we , human , will die out as well . The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals . In other words , doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation . 	16	2	"Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance , it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life . To begin with , it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying . The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human ' s life . Thus even if they are volunteers ; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines . Furthermore , it also have potentially harm for human ' s health without any testing . "	17	1	In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	17	2	Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	17	3	Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	18	1	Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	18	2	However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . The job selection criteria are pre decided . For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . They prefer male staff for night shifts . They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	19	1	Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money . If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan , electricity , water or even for a meal . If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working , because they will not have money to pay for everything . There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home , because parents will take care for them . Moreover , parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying . 	19	2	Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant , who they do not like . His habits may be totally different from theirs , his behavior may be inappropriate , but they will have to live with him or even share a room , in order to have less expenses . Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults . When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view , they will not be able to ask him for advice . Furthermore , they are most likely to quarrel every day , instead of to help each other . 	20	1	First , in most industrialized countries , there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions . The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution . While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses , most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution . If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause . 	20	2	Second , private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating . As house heating is a major need in the winter time , some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes . Instead of this , some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution . In my opinion , by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution . 	20	3	On the other hand , I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies . Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air , instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals . 	21	1	We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements . Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product . When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases . Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV . The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot . As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases . 	insufficient21	2	Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes . Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . They make the product preferable . 	22	1	To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons . From their point of view , the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation , such as mechanics , sales persons , or engineers , and , furthermore , labors for graduates are in short supply . What is worse , the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying . In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time-consuming . 	22	2	However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine . These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world . More importantly , many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society . Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships . 	23	1	First of all , almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems . Mobile phones are not out of expectation . Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas , such as schools , libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive . What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other . Nevertheless , it is not impossible to solve these problems , as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented . 	23	2	It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal . It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers , although the further investigation are needed . 	23	3	Another debatable problem is about techniques . There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party . This possibility exists all the time . But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users . 	23	4	Moreover , the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life . Not only used for communication , but it also functions as an Internet browser , a music player , a personal organizer and so forth . 	24	1	First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted . 	24	2	Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . For instance , several teenagers play games without rest , which leads to health depression , a typical example is the death of Korean gamer , who had a non-stop playing for 3 days . 	insufficient24	3	Finally , even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much . Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying . 	25	1	First of all , a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate . To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit . What is more , the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area . For example , the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers ' accommodation need . 	25	2	The main disadvantage is contamination . It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems . For instance , in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems , such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances . 	insufficient25	3	However , it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society . Therefore , how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it . In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well . 	26	1	First of all , to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious , almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people . Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences . For instance , there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases . Thus , easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health . 	insufficient26	2	Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition . It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food . Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need , especially for children who are growing up . 	26	3	In addition , cooking is one of arts humans create . The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose . At the increasing living pace , the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes . But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits , which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking . 	27	1	Firstly , education is an essential part in development . For instance , most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities . From this example , it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support . Thus , the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid . 	27	2	In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market . Indeed , they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas . Therefore , developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries . 	28	1	First of all , I do support the idea that advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children . Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis . Fortunately , some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol , cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries . 	28	2	On the other hand by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services . Thanks to ads we learn about new products , we can compare them and choose what ‰Ûª s the best for us . 	28	3	These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising . For example , tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic ' s economy . In order to promote the country ' s attractions , the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers . Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country . 	insufficient29	1	Firstly , extra income that women earn will contribute to their family ' s expenses . By taking up a job , a wife can earn more money to support her family life . This is really necessary in cases of her husband ' s low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present . So , it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money . 	29	2	Secondly , working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world , strengthen their character and show their capacity . These things in turn will make them more confident , independent . These women will set a good example for their children . Therefore , it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better . 	29	3	Last but not least , nowadays , there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work . Besides the gorvernment ' s policies on limited families and their husbands ' sharing in the housework , many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women . 	30	1	Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees . In the other hand , I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education . It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education . 	30	2	Moreover , students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it . They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves . In addition to that , the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well . 	30	3	Furthermore , this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future . 	31	1	Firstly , an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution . Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air , the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants . Therefore , it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles . 	31	2	Secondly , an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion . Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while . What is worse , traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents . Thus , the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented . 	31	3	In order to solve these problems , alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively . With regard to the former , alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal . For example , rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries . This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee . Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses , it is a better form to protect environment than automobile . As for the latter point , the introduction of international laws can be also effective . For instance , there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only . Thus , these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution . 	insufficient32	1	First of all , poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer . To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies . Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business . In actual , republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s . Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties . 	insufficient32	2	Secondly , aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people . If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted . It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization . 	32	3	Third , the campaigns might include practical benefits . In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others . When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt . 	insufficient33	1	Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country . They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments . 	33	2	Those who disagree , believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects . Developing globalization , people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world . In addition , they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries . 	33	3	Moreover , the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization . 	34	1	First of all , schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying . It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things . Second of all , schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students . Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences . Therefore , they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future . For example , as we know , employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills . 	34	2	Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job . Whether children can learn a lot at school , there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future . Furthermore , children can learn social skills when they have a job . They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school . Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they ' ve earned . 	35	1	To boost their sales and win over customers , companies pour a great amount of money into advertising . Most of the time , it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product . By which I mean , huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product . By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly since youngsters , as the target consumers , love celebrities . Since having these products shows their status , the quality obviously is not relatively important . 	35	2	However , despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated , it is also true that it plays and important role economically . They introduce new products , and provide various choices , not to mention they are often visually enjoyable , since they aim to grab your attention . Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels , creates a fair environment for commercial competition . Otherwise the market may be monopolistic , and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective . 	36	1	The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	insufficient36	2	Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	insufficient36	3	Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	insufficient37	1	An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world . For the time of occasions , people regardless of nationality , origin and religion will live together . People can understand more about a country , it is useful to ease tensions between nations . For example in FIFA World Cup 2010 , the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking . The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action . However , due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism . It is rare times when people can learn about this country . It really help to alleviate the tension . 	insufficient37	2	Besides easing tensions , an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way . When they garther together to encourage their team , they will show their patriotic emotions . Regardless of the competition between teams , their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport . Moreover , all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media . They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people . In Olympic Beijing 2008 , Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country . First of all , foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students . They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality , beauty in each cities . Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world . 	insufficient38	1	In the first instance , the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products . About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one . Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies . Thus , most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people . 	insufficient38	2	Secondly , technical developments improve productivity , which help people to escape from daily chores , and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life . With the development of Internet , we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day . In the past time , we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us . Nowadays , we can talk with our friends online , no matter where we are and how far between us . In addition , the Internet gives everyone access to the same information , this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals . 	38	3	Undoubtedly , everything has two sides and technology is not an exception . To some extent , the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology , because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products , and these products can help them to earn more in return . Nevertheless , I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap . 	39	1	Firstly , many facts about solar system can be discovered . For instance , a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round , not flat . Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun , not vice versa . If it was not for the space exploration , we would never know these facts . 	insufficient39	2	Secondly , people can know more about the planet earth itself . By observing planet earth from outer space , people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth . With this knowledge , people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming . 	insufficient39	3	Finally , a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented . As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in , scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks . Oxygen tanks , for instance , are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater . Moreover , spaceships , communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society . 	40	1	It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs . Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities . In addition , that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities . As a result , students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience . Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . 	40	2	Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained . Also , working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities . 	40	3	Lastly , doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation . Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students . With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved . Moreover , that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life . 	41	1	To begin with , students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to . In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom . As a result , students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation . For this reason , the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy . 	41	2	As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money . In addition , the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan . Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training . Therefore , companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation . 	42	1	A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places . Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile . For instance , junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want . If the teachers receive higher salaries , they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth , as this is what is happening in Taiwan . 	insufficient42	2	Nevertheless , I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances . Take Google for example , the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce . By doing this , the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured . 	insufficient43	1	Firstly , during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event . For example , when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers . This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality . Thus , world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace . 	insufficient43	2	Secondly , these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country . For instance , when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field . South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night . This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team . As a result , it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events . 	insufficient44	1	Firstly , the major source of energy today is water . Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source . To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short . Thus , during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India . If the government encourage the use of nuclear , solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity . Therefore , it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources . 	44	2	Secondly , the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming . For example , the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming . In the same way , the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution . 	insufficient45	1	Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . Tax revenue is collected from those who works . Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority . 	45	2	Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all . 	45	3	Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again . 	46	1	A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	46	2	On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	47	1	To begin with , it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings . Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures . As a result , the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression . It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives . 	47	2	Nevertheless , supporters would argue that zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside . They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting . However , I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat . It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide . 	48	1	To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains . 	48	2	Nevertheless , opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates . They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life . It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive . 	49	1	To begin with , mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business . With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds . Furthermore , it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world . With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine . Therefore , it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind . 	49	2	Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits . They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money . Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services . Consequently , people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies . 	50	1	It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology . Therefore , many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music . I have an impression that students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time . In this case , music can be a useful and interesting solution . Moreover , if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life . In fact , students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music . Consequently , the calm atmosphere in the class might be created . 	50	2	By contrast , it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students . In our hectic life , however , demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees . Hence , I agree with the majority , because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it . Increasingly however , students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously . Therefore , music and other entertaining subjects should be optional . Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace . To my mind , students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song . 	51	1	First , I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university . All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities . 	insufficient51	2	Second , usually libraries do not have income . Most libraries are free not for students also for public . Hence , universities support is vital for libraries . But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors . Also , they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets . To conclude , there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income . 	51	3	Last but not least , investing in libraries has a long-time result . For example , a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers . Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time . Besides , in the far future , they become more valuable . On the other side , most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time . 	52	1	Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people . First of all , it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly . In the ancient time , the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas . Fortunately , the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers . If we can popularize the use of English , the language hinder will disappear as well . In addition , English is a beautiful language , which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages . Learning English can foster people ' s sentiment and nourish their literature and art . 	52	2	"However , the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct . Even English is a sophisticated language ; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries , which have totally different linguistic system . It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people ' s daily life , which is influenced by culture , environment as well as religious . Obviously , these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity . "	53	1	Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	53	2	On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	54	1	On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication . 	54	2	"On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture . "	55	1	The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized . In the first place , with some basic knowledge of diverse fields , students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future . Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate . In students ' point of view , the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes . However , still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum , instead , they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done . Besides , most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs . 	55	2	Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness . This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects . However , the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected . Most importantly , under such target-oriented education environment , teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study . Moreover , the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study . 	56	1	No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	insufficient56	2	Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	57	1	Time and again , creative artists like Michaelangelo , Picasso , Salman Rushdie , Shakespeare etc . have made artistic works which gave a social message . Right from sculptures to paintings , books to drama and movies , all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras . Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message . 	insufficient57	2	Nonetheless , innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience . It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments . For instance , Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government , just because she raised a social issue . This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds . In addition , creativity also gives aesthetic charm . 	insufficient57	3	"Unfortunately , many governments restrict the artists . Frank Zappa once said , "" Mind is like a parachute , it doesn ' t work if its not open "" . Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains . Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely . "	58	1	Co-operation is essential for teamwork . Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children . We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success . A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . For instance , lions hunt in a team . It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate . 	insufficient58	2	Nevertheless , co-operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes . It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others . A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements . However , competition is also as important as co-operation . 	58	3	Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others . Competition has helped the development of science and technology . Competition helps in improvement and evolution . For example , every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others . This kind of competition gives customers more options . 	insufficient58	4	However , blind and selfish competition is detrimental . ' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run . Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule . A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach . 	59	1	"Capital punishment is given only in the "" rarest of the rare "" cases . Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings . When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment . Thus , capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals . "	59	2	Moreover , capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes . When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes . Thus , the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased . 	59	3	Importantly , capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals . Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment . 	59	4	However , the jury giving the verdict are also humans . They have the life of a person at their discretion . They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals . The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime . For example , if an individual murders someone for self-defense , then such a crime is not heinous . Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment . 	60	1	In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change . A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions . Personally , a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies . Importantly , when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge . 	60	2	Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest . It will also help them to learn professional setup by working . Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job . Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course . 	60	3	However , there are also disadvantages . A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental . When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia . For instance , my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted . When he started his university studies , he failed miserably . Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time . But , the break should be an optional thing . It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period . A break gives students more benefits than harms . 	insufficient61	1	In the modern world , computers are used everywhere . Right from flying planes to sending a small document , computers are needed . They are used in space programs , wars , hospitals , schools and so on . Computers have made human life more easy , convenient and lightning fast . For example , in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country , it used to take months . But today , it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks . Computers provide speed , increase efficiency , accuracy , precision , help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it . 	61	2	Moreover , future prospects of computers are very bright . From a computer as big as a room , it has now been minimized to the size of a palm . Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels . Research on making computerized drone soldiers ( unmanned computer controlled ) is going on . There is no end to the evolution of computers . 	61	3	However , everything has pros and cons . Computers have made humans over-dependent . Virus programs , privacy breach , leak of confidential documents , cyber attacks , identity theft , frauds etc . are some of its demerits , from a countless list . Computers expose children to vulgar materials . They have even invaded mental health of humans , for example , FAD ( Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook ) . Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives . The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful . 	62	1	Right to education is a basic human right of both , males and females . The whole world aims for women empowerment , and to achieve this , females should be given equal opportunities as males . When universities will accept them in equal number , both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop . 	62	2	Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other . It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together . For example , students studying in boy ' s colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them . On the other hand , females studying in girl ' s colleges are too shy to face boys . Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both . Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run . 	62	3	Unfortunately , some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc . This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society . Time and again , women have proved their mettle in every field . Women like Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi , Mari Curie etc . , are symbols of women ' s intelligence and skills . 	63	1	The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time . As a result , people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years . Actually , in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework . And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology . Thus , it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future . 	63	2	Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves . According to a recent survey , 89% of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on . Thus , they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal . Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study . 	63	3	Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family . To some extent , it is true . However , as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality . Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed , thus health and life of eaters is assured . Besides , along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities . Consequently , it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time . 	64	1	It is true that modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend . This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games , which , in fact , helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future . At the same time , children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology , raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative . 	64	2	However , I think traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society . One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills . Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines , traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat , laugh and cooperate face to face . As a result , communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more . 	64	3	Furthermore , it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today . In fact , these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children ' s skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices . By contrast , modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits . Therefore , there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival . 	65	1	Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums . As a matter of fact , an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals , whereas a physical damaged person , resulting from the lack of medical treatment , may no longer participate in any sports games . Therefore , providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government . 	65	2	Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented . Their existences are based on their marketing strategies , the condition of facilities and the volume of audience . The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market , which should not be interfered by government . Instead , the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits , which deserves more funds from government . 	65	3	Furthermore , putting taxpayers ' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them . For example , not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot . Therefore , it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs . That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support , because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis . 	66	1	In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life . In the past , only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles . This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills . However , with the access to the Internet , one of the greatest innovations in modern society , humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime , anywhere . 	66	2	Additionally , technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing . For example , China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo , using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods , such as robots and LED screens . In fact , many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture . 	insufficient66	3	On the other hand , some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles . They argue that people , especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques . But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years . 	67	1	"One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . "	67	2	"Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide ‰ÛÒ these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . "	68	1	Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences . This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who , lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong , are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable . 	68	2	On the other hand , media , such as TV or film , is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government . It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society . Violence , as one of the facts in the real world , certainly has to be reported . However , excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well . It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members , one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy . In the real world , we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure . 	insufficient69	1	"To start with , the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society . Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children . Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on . This is to say , the "" weaker "" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men , not to mention they even perform better in some fields . "	69	2	In the second place , the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well . The financial burden of families , for instance , has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money . What is more , women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration . 	69	3	Admittedly , such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or , under many circumstances , women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives . Also , children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work . Yet everything has it upside and downside , women should find the best way to overcome such challenges . 	70	1	"Specifically , price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area ; however , whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated . On one hand , governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands . Consequently , it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly . On the other hand , pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution . In addition , the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours . "	70	2	As illustrated before , several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems . Primarily , authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities , such as constructing more bus lines , in order to reducing the usage of private cars . Furthermore , temporarily targets should be set , with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time , for example , a season . Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems . Meanwhile , cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out , though it might not be into effect immediately , but in the long run , it would be a wise choice . 	71	1	First , it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring . In fact , they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture , good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor . 	71	2	Besides , it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies . In a larger sense , it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country . A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign , the sales revenue would increase by 40% , which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic . 	71	3	That is not to say , however , that advertisements have no downsides . Of course , the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information , creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies . Yet , its merits still outweigh these downsides . 	72	1	It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health . Any kinds of sports , such as jogging , swimming , or playing basketball , can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system . Moreover , these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body . The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity . Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years , which mainly results from insufficient exercises . 	72	2	Sports activities can improve mental health as well . When people exercise , the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine . This hormone can delight one ' s mind , creating positive feelings . Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one ' s heavy burdens . Moreover , rigorous exercise can also hone one ' s will , which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks . 	73	1	Firstly , pictures can influence the way people think . For example , nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking . As a result , statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit . Not only that , the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan . Apart from that , images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements . Thus , it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many . 	insufficient73	2	Looking from another perspective , written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages . With only pictures , everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images . Nonetheless , this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about . Furthermore , the primary way of educating students is also by this way . Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better . 	74	1	First and foremost , it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country . It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country . The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist . Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting . What is more , it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more . 	74	2	On the other hand , there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages . Although governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results . As evidence of this , there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those . These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular . In addition , the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre . If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money . 	75	1	Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is . In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens . This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people ' s lives for a well-rounded social system . 	75	2	Admittedly , art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives , for example , it could bring release one ' s heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work . However , it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries , in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room . By comparison to these issues , the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all . 	76	1	Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens . This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society . If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk . As a result , such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry . Also , without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security . Therefore , the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable . 	76	2	On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society , since a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately . Instead , the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address . 	77	1	There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system , which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals . In contrast , zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff . Once the animal got sick , professional vet will help them promptly . Thanks to the considerate care , the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed . 	77	2	Additionally , zoos afford a platform to education teenagers , helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals . In the zoos , even though wild animals are caged , they have capability to walk in a limited area . When children pay a visit to the zoos , they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals , which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals . Further , children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers . 	77	3	On the other hand , complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard . It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage . Also , being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals . 	78	1	Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	78	2	However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	insufficient78	3	Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . Therefore , it may spur its economic development . On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	79	1	Admittedly , the government should give priority to public services and facilities . This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable . Simultaneously , public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate . Therefore , public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability . 	79	2	On the other hand , I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government . Individually , arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives . Currently , people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition . Consequently , they require various entertainment such as music , movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure . Without arts , people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems . 	79	3	From the point of the local community , funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development . Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts . This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage , which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry . In this view , arts serve cultural and economic purposes . 	80	1	First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe . 	80	2	On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced . 	81	1	First and foremost , if there is control over artists ' ideas , they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run . It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves , most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies . For example , paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times . In short , without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists . 	insufficient81	2	Furthermore , it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation . Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries . Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country . To illustrate this further , the famous movie ' 3 Idiots ' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn . Thus , human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely . 	insufficient81	3	Looking from another perspective , there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted . They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country . To cite an example , Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace . In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society . Nonetheless , I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts . 	insufficient82	1	First , it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more . Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits . Also , to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits . For example , customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans . From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support . 	insufficient82	2	However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts . Firstly , a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people . Secondly , advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results . Therefore , advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses . 	83	1	First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons . Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons . If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage . 	83	2	Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity . For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area . This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable . 	insufficient83	3	Last but not least , while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power . Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it . This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material . 	84	1	In a positive point of view , when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet , they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities . For example , they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them . With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job . Not only that , the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with . In short , if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive . 	84	2	Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money . This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country . To illustrate this further , the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living . To conclude , the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed . 	84	3	Furthermore , when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity . It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless . Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones . In this context , the public ' s money is spent worthlessly . On top of that , till now , there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment . 	85	1	Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	insufficient85	2	Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	85	3	Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . However , one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences . Ergo , opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime . 	86	1	To begin with , it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides . For instance , in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life . Therefore , it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities . 	insufficient86	2	What is more , it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities . Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment . For example playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc . However , in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities . Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms . 	86	3	Finally , in big cities children access to media easily , so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net . Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world , therefor they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures . 	87	1	"In the first place , there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others . In your job you can be boss of yourself ; however , in the other jobs someone else are your boss . You always have to be responsible for your task , and it make a stressful situation that I never like it . "	87	2	What is more , when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager . Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers , and from my point of view it is unfair . 	87	3	Finally , there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others . When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want . Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease , sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation . For all of them we have to ask for a permission , and most of the time we are not allowed . 	88	1	First of all , when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes . For instance , most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats , but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems . 	insufficient88	2	Second of all , experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile . For example , scientists experiment a substance for a long time , after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final . 	insufficient89	1	Firstly , day by day population is increasing , so human needs for food is increasing as well . We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn , and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks . Therefore , farmlands are vital for human life . 	89	2	Secondly , people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals , so they need land to build their houses on it . Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable . 	89	3	Finally , human need some crucial things to continue their life , and most of them are industrial such as medicine . Therefore , some lands should be assigned to industry . Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry . 	90	1	"First of all , there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing , therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance . For example , some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality . "	insufficient90	2	Second of all , there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague . For instance , I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her . One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home . She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable . After that I understood , I had to never judge with people ' s appearance . 	insufficient91	1	It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation . As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation . In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them . Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose . 	91	2	Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions . If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles . For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience . 	91	3	In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation . This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong . For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English . 	insufficient92	1	This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today . When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting-edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world . In contrast , if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds . As a result , they might fall behind shortly . 	92	2	Furthermore , people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information . Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles . 	92	3	Despite this , it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities . Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes . Consequently , the world would look monotonous . 	93	1	In terms of ethics , it is inhumane to watch one ' s fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help , especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so . Compassion , a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism , is what distinguishes us human beings from animals . 	93	2	"Economically speaking , such aid could also create a win-win situation . Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds . For developed nations , new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations ; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem , promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry . The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning . By building a good relationship with them , wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market , but also facilitate future international commerce . The underdeveloped nations , in return , may export local agricultural products , mineral products with discount to the former , boosting each other ' s economy . "	94	1	Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations . First of all , thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences . For example , if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age , he also keeps it when older . Secondly , health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases . Instead of afraid or panic , they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes . Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment . Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly . 	94	2	Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens . For example , vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu , smallpox , rubella so on . When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably . As human resources play a key role in the development of a country , investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision . In addition , because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention , the government can save a lot of money for our country ' s health budget . 	insufficient95	1	First and foremost , today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before . The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody . People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want , from musical concerts to live football match . This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work . Obviously , the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings . 	95	2	In addition to this , news media help people broaden their knowledge . It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields , including political situation , economic change , global warming , and so forth . Hence , there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better . This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society . Indeed , the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide . 	96	1	First and foremost , I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal . This is because , knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment . For instance , take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty . The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person . Then , punishment can be given in accordance to the condition . 	insufficient96	2	Apart from that , a fair trial can be achieved . As all of us know , juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law . Thus , exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision . By doing so , the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences . Not only that , the convicted will also receive a fair action . 	96	3	It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized . If finally he is proven innocent , he may feel embarrassed to face the public . However , I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well . 	97	1	First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	97	2	Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . However , the hooligans only took a minority of people . Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	insufficient98	1	First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money . When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life . Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving . 	98	2	Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working . To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties . For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost . 	insufficient98	3	Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers . However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way . 	99	1	Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way . It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent . Student ' s who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies . This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life . They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses . 	99	2	Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts . Once student ' s starts earning , they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence . They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment . There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education . Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education , which will help them to get a better job and salaries . This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs , one needs a proper and higher qualification . 	100	1	First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	100	2	Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . Take for instance those who start their own business . These people depend solely on hard work and luck . Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	insufficient100	3	In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	insufficient101	1	First and foremost , if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates . As a result , most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for . To illustrate this further , a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available . On top of that , due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace . 	insufficient101	2	Apart from that , not all elderly workers are physically well . Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses . To cite an example , the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him . Consequently , they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing . Besides , the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution . Thus , it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones . 	insufficient101	3	Admittedly , the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated . Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation . Hence , it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge . 	102	1	Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique . 	insufficient102	2	"In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . While if you "" visit "" the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience . "	insufficient102	3	Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects . 	103	1	Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury . We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality . Furthermore , past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder . 	103	2	Nevertheless , in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only . For instance , a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record . Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions . 	104	1	First and foremost , the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils . Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace . As such , the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever . Moreover , with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance . College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries . Last but not least , the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying . While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query . 	104	2	In the near future , the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously ? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances . 	104	3	Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs . However , we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself . Thus , what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study . 	105	1	Admittedly , more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines . The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs . With advanced technology , the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines , which can cure a variety of serious illnesses . If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs , their health situations may be better . The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity . 	105	2	However , the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness . Apparently , the process of researching , testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money . Moreover , these products prove to ensure human health completely . Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs , they would make no profit , even running up debt because of production expenditure . Therefore , the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation . In short , this is not a long-term solution . 	105	3	Fortunately , there are other measures to improve the situation . It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes . Additionally , charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free . 	106	1	Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	insufficient106	2	Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafÌ©s , hospital and shopping street . This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	insufficient107	1	Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . 	107	2	Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . 	107	3	Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . 	insufficient108	1	Admittedly , encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits . Firstly , fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation . This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities . Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency . Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline . 	108	2	However , sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences . From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations . It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity . From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government . For example , sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently . 	109	1	One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content . They have a serious impact on people in their puberty . For example , an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off . Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture . A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser . This is actually very environmentally unfriendly . 	insufficient109	2	The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . In other words , the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases . Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths . Even so , another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest . 	insufficient110	1	Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries . If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy . Therefore , they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen . 	110	2	Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax . In fact , in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government . In this way , the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace . Furthermore , being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history . For instance , people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books . On the other hand , a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation . Indeed , if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other . 	111	1	There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned . Firstly , the costs outweigh the benefits . Every year , cosmetic companies , farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products , without any beneficial result . Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money , since they must be fed , cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances . 	111	2	Secondly , animals are kept in unnatural conditions . Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly , which influences their reactions to drugs . In March 2003 , a lab technician shot a video inside a lab , which revealed primates in cages without pain medication , for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head . Consequently , I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity . 	insufficient111	3	There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals . Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading , since animals and people ' s response to a drug can be different . I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual . 	112	1	"There are clearly advantages to exams . They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates . They are also relatively versatile ; different types of exam questions , for example , multiple-choice questions and essay tasks , can test different sorts of reasoning ability . However , exams also have some drawbacks . Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills . In contrast , some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety . In this case , teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all . "	112	2	A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns . Wherever possible , exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment . Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills . Other types of assessment should also be considered , assignment writing , for example , to assess independent learning and research skills , or group projects , to measure teamwork ability . 	113	1	Firstly , in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations . High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident . On top of that , poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients . To solve these issues , richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals . 	113	2	Secondly , in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions . Besides that , education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it . In order to solve the education manpower problem , richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries . Meanwhile , for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students . 	113	3	Lastly , in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money . Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure . For example , residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production . As a token of goodwill , richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading . The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading . 	114	1	There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers . Firstly , computers need to be operated by people . No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today . For example , lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector . However , scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching . I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers , but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human ' s touch . 	114	2	Secondly , children need human interactions . No matter how advanced technology will be , it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils . As a recent interview with Josh Trumm ‰ÛÒ the founder of the ' Teachers Global Group ' - reveals , human interactions will never be imitated by computers : ' This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education . Without someone who can explain and understand their problems , pupils cannot actually learn ' . I am inclined to agree with this scientific view , because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils , be a friend and a model . 	insufficient115	1	Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	115	2	However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	115	3	Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	116	1	The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists . For example , monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists . In fact , some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue , thus , the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry . 	116	2	In addition , sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation . Therefore , culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art . Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country ' s history and culture by observing various work crafts . 	116	3	Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted . Indeed , not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts . Hence , this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature . 	117	1	Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment . They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment . If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment . 	117	2	On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment . They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back . We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart . 	117	3	There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot . One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa . By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource . Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 . By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions . If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental . It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes . It would mean another industrial revolution . 	insufficient118	1	First of all , some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own . For example , hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship . They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves . In addition , although there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately . Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts . 	insufficient118	2	However , their talents should not be overrated . Other people say that singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society . It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms . While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life . They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience . Indeed , their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary . Hence , their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities . 	119	1	Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate . Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children . 	119	2	On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings . Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts . As a result , information from those sources is subject to question . Admittedly , the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can . Through face-to-face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students . This is where the computer proves to be incompetent . 	120	1	First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	120	2	Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	120	3	The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	121	1	Firstly , if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants . As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances . 	insufficient121	2	Moreover , if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit , they will produce products with low qualities and high prices , therefore they might hit consumer ' s life . For instance , a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk , sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die . 	insufficient122	1	Firstly , I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education . Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities . Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition , so the students can ' t study well during the classes . They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school . 	122	2	Secondly , the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city . After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions . For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch . This will increase the social connections of the students . The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions . The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed , but I think this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions . 	insufficient123	1	In the first place , there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children , therefore they are the best advisor for their children . They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life , so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things . Also , they can save value things in their life such as time and money , and enjoy they life with the best way . 	123	2	Moreover , I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers , because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money . They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily . 	124	1	In the first place , children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare . Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs . Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them . 	124	2	In addition , in this age they are not expected to be responsible . Also , they do not have to educate and they do not have to work , so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life . As a matter of fact , I made a large number of friends in this age , and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten . Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age . 	insufficient125	1	First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	125	2	Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	insufficient125	3	Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	126	1	We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant . First , it ' s not easy to make friend with anyone . I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other . After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways . Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances . We spend time together but we could never be friend . So , it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends . 	insufficient126	2	Second , close friends can easily understand each others feelings . Because of the similarity I talked before , acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends . Moreover , they wouldn ' t even spare time to consider your feelings . Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time . Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend . When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible . If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business . And I believe my friend will do the same to me . In conclusion , a friend is a person you care about . 	insufficient127	1	The first reason is life is simple in the past . Nowadays , all humans compete together . Since world population getting higher , competition is getting fierce . If you are not able to handle your jobs , then someone will replace you right away . People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition . Therefore , lives in the old days is easier than today . 	127	2	Second , the environment today is serious damaged . Looking out the windows , what I see isn ' t sky , trees or mountains , but is coldly high buildings . Everyday , I walk on hard roads , breath in polluted air , and live in a limited space . What ' s worse , it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases . Thus , the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today . 	insufficient127	3	"The third reason is that the pace of life . Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes ; however , it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life . If we cannot react properly and immediately , then we will be in a vulnerable situation . We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace . "	128	1	First of all , as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study . Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights . As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams . 	128	2	Next , students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades . Also , we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students . For example , when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other . Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit . 	insufficient128	3	Lastly , the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she / he has an aptitude . When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education . Furthermore , this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses . 	129	1	"The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . "	insufficient129	2	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	insufficient129	3	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	insufficient130	1	The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region . This takes place , not only through direct expenditure from tourists , but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , agriculture , and in the service industry . The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation , luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid , well-regulated tourism programs . Furthermore , tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , hotels , transport , agriculture , and in the service industry . This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes . As a result , this gives energy to the economic cycle , generating local economic prosperity in return . 	130	2	Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism . In fact , compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers . For instance , paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers , causing severe water pollution . On the other hand , the dramatic majority of tourist , particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages , are well educated . It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so . 	insufficient131	1	First of all , there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way . Admittedly , no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication . However , these could only help individuals with their physical requirements . There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts . 	131	2	On top of this , the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society . No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration . Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways . 	131	3	Furthermore , investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally . The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions . 	132	1	A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family . But with the recent recession , almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall . This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers . As a result , people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition . 	132	2	"Moreover , the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment . The official term of it is named "" Technological Unemployment "" . North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that , technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one . For example , robots , automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks , interpreters , security services , retails and specially in manufacturing companies . Thus many people ' s jobs are now at high stake . The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs . Last but not least , corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors . "	133	1	I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people . A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to , due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working . As it can be seen from the example , the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected . 	insufficient133	2	However , using computer can make people easier to complete their work . Businessmen , for example , use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues . Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country . This is due to using computer more efficient and , many workers cannot do more in work without computer . 	insufficient134	1	Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . 	insufficient134	2	On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . 	135	1	International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems . Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards . They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs . What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members . It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support . 	insufficient135	2	Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens . After all , charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected . Another reason is that , even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs . By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth . 	136	1	It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge . Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced . A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time . Moreover , when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs . Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button . Thus , technologies are vital in students ' learning . 	insufficient136	2	On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators . At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way . Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable . 	137	1	As a matter of fact , world sport events provide positive waves for number of people . The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team . These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too . Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased . For example , the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun . 	insufficient137	2	"Moreover , these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs . Thus , if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different . In other words , this is the "" calm before the storm "" . After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority . To picture it , recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea . "	insufficient138	1	To begin with , studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense . Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time , tuition fees , textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection . This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line . 	138	2	Besides that , long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches . Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click , such as science reports , study posts , documentary records , etc . A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course . 	138	3	It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations . These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils ' personalities . But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies , remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts . 	139	1	Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem . If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat . Therefore , it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible . 	139	2	However , I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution . The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being . A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment . On most occasions , the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it . 	139	3	Furthermore , human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars . When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help . We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species . 	140	1	To begin with , judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular . Nowadays , both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education . In India , for example , female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations . 	insufficient140	2	Furthermore , female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females . In addition , due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments , female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace , despite its intensive stress and pressure . For example , Chanda Kochhar , who is the CEO of India ' s second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country ' s most powerful female head in business sector . 	insufficient141	1	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing . Sometimes , face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle . He once complained a service of a restaurant . Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it . Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication . If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important . Therefore , we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way . 	insufficient141	2	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication . For instance , I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric . He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore . I just shocked and did not know what happened . Finally , I realized that his facebook account was stolen . Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face . 	insufficient141	3	"Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication . However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words . Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us . "	142	1	The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health . They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity . In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost . 	142	2	In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society . In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy . It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people . 	142	3	On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system . Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care . They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system . 	143	1	The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	insufficient143	2	Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	insufficient143	3	Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	144	1	First , focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality . Unlike middle school or high school , university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge . In fact , some students may be capable in high schools , but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones . That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions , since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone . 	144	2	Secondly , university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes . Some people argue that this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' , but actually it gives no harm to the whole community . Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone , while complex ones should be only handled by the best people , who start their career from the best institutions . I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning , which makes them do the best to improve themselves . Ultimately , this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society . 	145	1	"The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have , the more chances we can increase our knowledge . For example , library is a good place for students to study or research . They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience ; also , there are a lot of references for students to utilize . With this convenient and versatile facility , students can improve their learning condition . Therefore , we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students . "	insufficient145	2	Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms . They have numerous activities in school . Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school . He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance . With this distinguished performance , the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind . Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities . 	insufficient145	3	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well . However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study . It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards . 	146	1	To begin with , students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested . They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject . For instance , a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field . 	insufficient146	2	Next , students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields . General education plays a significant role in specialized education . Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics . In addition , although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects . For instance , you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry . Therefore , high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university . 	insufficient146	3	Last but not least , students have tendency to shun difficulties . They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much . This might result in limited choices in the future . Therefore , schools should be responsible for their future and protect them . 	147	1	The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	insufficient147	2	Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	insufficient148	1	Firstly , most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology . Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint . For example , students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students . 	insufficient148	2	Secondly , new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world . Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field . For example , many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries . This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries . 	insufficient148	3	"Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them . This point has some merits on the surface ; however , many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures . In fact , cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet . For example , two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad . "	insufficient149	1	First of all , more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university . Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did , they can provide more advices and helps in our career . In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage . For example , my grandparents did not get a education even in high school , so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help . Things have changed a lot . I grow up in a better condition than my father did . Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help . They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot . 	insufficient149	2	What is more , family members can help us in many other aspects . For example , when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors . He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot . Parents are quite experienced than their child , they can guide them toward the right direction . Besides , parents can told their children as many as they can . What they want is help their child to make a progress . 	insufficient150	1	Firstly , fiction books pay more attention to details . In fact , we can know characters , places , and times of a novel very well during reading it . Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels , where each scene is happening . For example , after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution , I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people . However , a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters . 	insufficient150	2	Secondly , reading a novel is more convenient . Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour . Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains . For example , I have started to read a novel since last week . I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day , so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class . In contrast , I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that , I have to study . 	insufficient150	3	"Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies . This point has some merits on the surface ; however , movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners . For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable . "	151	1	"A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way . Due to globalization , many people are traveling for professional trips . So , communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places . Furthermore , students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages ; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment . Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people . Adding to that , exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics , medical , astronomy etc would become easier . "	151	2	"On the other hand , few people are worried about the dying local languages . These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures . They represent local culture . As the usage of these languages decrease , culture also changes accordingly . Further , these languages are tightly coupled with history ; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost . "	152	1	We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place . A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones . The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts . Moreover , some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication . In my opinion though , social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch , the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago . 	insufficient152	2	The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and , thus , a happier place to live in . Today , even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists . The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives . To be specific , scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body , which is a miraculous breakthrough . In general , the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine . 	153	1	The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	insufficient153	2	In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	insufficient154	1	Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . This means you can get more for less . For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . 	insufficient154	2	Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together . For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along . Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other . We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games . We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends . Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me . 	insufficient154	3	Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help . It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need . When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help . Some of them may have something to offer . To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help . They failed to give me any useful solutions . To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help . He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly . 	insufficient155	1	First of all , restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals . Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals . They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them . 	155	2	Secondly , restaurants are places that people usually come with their families . This means , there will be children , grandparents , as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants . Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children . Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something . Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders ' health , especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs . The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies . 	155	3	Last but not least , passive smokers will have a lot of health risks . When they are around the active smokers , they will inhale hazardous smoke . Stroke , heart disorders , hearing loss , and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers . Personally speaking , it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one . 	156	1	In the first place , children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best . Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs . Imagine an actor who is a child ‰Ûª s favorite is doing violent roles . In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him . Thus , unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child ‰Ûª s behaviors . 	156	2	Meanwhile , human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters . For instance , dying is always a disappointing happening . Furthermore , killing is worse . Therefore , if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child . 	156	3	Finally , beside all above mentioned items , the study of youngsters shall always been controlled . For example , a child watches a frightening movie . On the other hand , he has to study for the exam . In this condition , because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it , it is obvious that he wouldn ‰Ûª t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly . Hence , the study of a youngster would affected terribly . 	157	1	The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability . Some people may disinform you on purpose , that ' s why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information . For example , Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia , however , european news announced that it was initiated by Russia . After a while the situation became clear , but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia . 	insufficient157	2	"Secondly , it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations , because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate . Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts , especially in the internet , that ' s why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts . It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone ' s personal opinion as a source of information , but it was actually wrong . For example , several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week , because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops . The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the "" salt-panic "" was over . "	insufficient158	1	There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing . Because of that need , governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings . Besides that , the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values . 	158	2	Old buildings are an essential part of history . Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings . Therefore , managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation . Furthermore , the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them . Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there . . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work . 	159	1	First of all , many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones . Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time , leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities . Similarly , internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works . In my college days , I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone . I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends . That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester . 	insufficient159	2	Secondly , juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic . They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand . Relatively , these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost . Furthermore , most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want . An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days , wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents . 	160	1	"First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime . Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance "" a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction "" . The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place . "	insufficient160	2	On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government . Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal . Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other . 	161	1	There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors . One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one ' s health . For instance , last year , I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball . Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing . Soccer , on the other hand , developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games . I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly . Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit , make me ultimately refreshed . After that summer , my body is stronger and endurance is better . 	insufficient161	2	Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people . When I was ten years old , I was a shy girl . My mother took me to The National Camp . At first , I just ate and played alone . But on the third day , while I was swimming , a friendly girl came and greeted me , we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively . On the next day , we played together and she introduced me to her friends . Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing , climbing the mountain , I had a lot of friends since The National Camp . If , for example , I hadn ' t participate in that camping , I wouldn ' t have had many friends like today . 	insufficient161	3	Moreover , you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking , sunbathing , going biking . If you spend your spare time at home or something like that , you can ' t enjoy beautiful nature . Spending time outdoors , people can breathe fresh air , feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings . 	162	1	It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	162	2	On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	163	1	On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area . To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace . What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city . 	163	2	On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town . You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities . For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising . But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs . 	insufficient163	3	Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information . If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals . For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones . If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice . 	insufficient163	4	There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring . Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers . Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development . 	164	1	Firstly , training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind . Clearly , in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer , complaining from boss , etc . Therefore , we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge . 	164	2	Secondly , employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained . In this case , the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company . So obviously , they will think about develop long term career with their company . For another thing , employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don ' t have this opportunity . 	164	3	Thirdly , providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge . Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business , so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result . Of course , excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss . 	165	1	Firstly , the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room . Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand . For example , I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university . She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast . Thus , she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic . Finally , she got very good grade when she was graduation . 	insufficient165	2	Secondly , students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well . In my experience , many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes . Also , I had already studied all biology topics before attending university . As a result , I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A + for both biology and chemistry . 	insufficient166	1	Big city life provides many opportunities . First of all , it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city . Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply . Therefore , a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town . 	insufficient166	2	At the weekends , there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis . There are numerous bars , cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends . Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines . I am fond of Italian food , and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city , I will definitely visit it . 	insufficient166	3	A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people . There a person can listen to music , make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone . Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one . I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings , sculptures or artifacts . On special dates , city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art . 	166	4	What ' s more , cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside . This can at least assure me that if I feel bad , city can provide a high quality help . 	167	1	First , computers through internet made our access to information easier . Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly , store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed . Search engines such as google , yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes . Social networks such as facebook , twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments . Hence , with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information , and can get it from different sources . 	167	2	Second , in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster , visual and cheaper . With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes . In addition , it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office , but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends , family members in any part of the world . Internet facilities such as msn , skype made visual communication possible . For example , via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends , but also make interviews for employment , enrolment into universities . In result , communication has become cheaper , faster and visual . 	168	1	Pressure is motivation . Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible . The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects . Then again , the workers must try their best to finish the time limit . Doing all jobs at home don ' t make employees attempt to work like this . 	168	2	Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind . Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites , however , they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job . The dos and don ' t at office play important role to prevent these things from workers . In condition , doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily . As a result , the project cannot being done . The best condition might not be good for people . 	168	3	Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices . Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people . Besides , interaction help employees improve their communicational skills , therefore , they will have more and more friends and relationships . Interaction is a factor increasing working quality . 	169	1	To begin with , it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge . The professors ‰Ûª duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses . If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes . The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies . In this way , professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students . Therefore , professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research . 	169	2	On the other hand , if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities . Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline . Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study . In this way , hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects . It is adverse to the whole academic field . Accordingly , spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research . 	169	3	Nevertheless , professors could teach students through research and projects . Some students enjoy taking part in some research . Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research . For instance , electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car . They can manage the electric theory in practical skills . And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions . However , only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research . This is requires professors provide high quality courses . In other word , professor should concern about preparing class . 	insufficient170	1	On one hand , the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards . Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools , which play an important role in economic activity . Because of the technology of internet and air transportation , businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions . This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue . 	170	2	Besides , advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard . With the improvement of medical technology , it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before , and many serious diseases are under control . Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies , and this means that we could get more happiness from technology . 	170	3	On the other hand , the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society . People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas , and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions . This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment . Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars , and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities . 	171	1	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	171	2	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	insufficient172	1	First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory . While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules . You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want . An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student . This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory . 	172	2	Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive . This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper . Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday . You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car . The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination . 	172	3	Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories . A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times . Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better . For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . You set your own schedules . In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them . 	173	1	When people visit the zoo , they normally do it in a group , with their families , or as a part of a school group activity . In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals , play with some of them , comment on their appearance and behavior , and laugh at their funny customs . Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago . The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family , it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member , from little children to grandparents . 	173	2	Animals , the different species , their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities . We can learn a lot from books and lectures , but there is an even better way to learn , that is visuals and personal experience . If you visit the zoo , you get to watch the animals , their customs , what they eat and how they eat it , as well as which characteristics the different species have . In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations , the male and the female or the baby and the adult . It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations , such as weather , specie and genre interaction , defense behavior , or protection of their babies . Moreover , it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous . Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school . 	173	3	Finally , a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone ' s respect and appreciation for animals . It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it , and learned from it . This is especially true for people living in the city , where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs . In the present there is a lack of respect for animals . Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve . 	174	1	"First , most serious movies have a wide variety of content . Entertaining movies are created to amuse people . However , most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical . Compared with the entertainment film , the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful . Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love , humaneness ; moreover , it may point out the dark sides of the society . "	174	2	"Second , not all of serious movies are boring . "" Click "" is a very interesting comedy , with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses . The movie is humorous and satiric , which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives , and it reminds us how important our families are . Thus , the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves . "	insufficient174	3	"Moreover , some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world . "" Blood diamond "" , an adaptation of a real story in South Africa , focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict . After watching the movie , we may learn a lesson between jewels and death . Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love ; indeed , the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality . As a result , serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way . "	insufficient175	1	It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people . The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip . However , journalism is changing . Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues , paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people . 	175	2	First of all , gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion . The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports , which seems to tell a story . Moreover , it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported . 	175	3	Furthermore , sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems . The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content , which can attract the audience . Thus , these personal reports of famous people , unimportant information or distorted stories , will not solve problem related with the society . In other words , yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news , such as education , environment and public issues . 	176	1	Primary , it is easy to know the history of the new place . Last year , I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum , where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York . Through the exhibit , I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom , and Ellis Island may be the place , where the immigration took their dreams and fears . Thus , museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place . 	insufficient176	2	Secondary , visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon . Those outstanding and diverse range of objects , with classic and magnificent art , is guaranteed to inspire us ! In my city , National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts . To my astonishment , Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work , which is made of jade , is vividly shown . 	insufficient176	3	Moreover , a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit . Someone take a trip without making any plans , so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel . As a result , visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision . Most important of all , a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time . 	177	1	Studying at home by using technology is convenient . The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . You can study any time you want . However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home . 	177	2	First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help . 	177	3	Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance-learning program may not be for you . 	177	4	"Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities . "	178	1	In the first place , the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping . Here is a positive example : Queens Center Mall , a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City , provides a wide vairtey of stores , products and services , from clothing to electronics and restaurants , that consumers can choose . It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York . I found that I could find virtually every brand or store , including Macy ' s and JCPenney , when I visited there . As far as I am concerned , a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time . 	insufficient178	2	Furthermore , it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs . There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall . It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job . Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money . 	178	3	Lastly , it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand . There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers . Accordingly , with sales promotion , it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy . In addition , the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes . 	179	1	Stress , our body ' s way of responding to any kind of demand , can be caused by both good and bad experiences . Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success . However , it is widely thought that we experience stress any time , which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals . As a result , if we don ' t have a good stress management skill , it may lead to some critical problems . 	179	2	"In the frenetic , fast-paced world , it is a very common predicament that all of us , from the young to the senior , feel depressed caused by stress , such as financial problems , exam stress , relationship difficulties and work overload . Some people regard stress as a power , which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best ; other people cannot charge of their thoughts , emotions , and the way they deal with problems . Therefore , stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization . "	179	3	Furthermore , stress takes a toll on our health . It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles , frustrations , and demands . This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress . Thus , some people have physical problems , such as insomnia and headaches . Melancholia , the most fatal problem , even leads some people to commit suicide . Consequently , it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body . To avoid being a pessimist , we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families , doing exercise regularly , and trying to see our troubles in a different way . 	180	1	In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups . Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups . 	180	2	By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose . A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year . When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term . Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job . 	insufficient180	3	"Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal . Here is an example : there are various charities in the world . Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks . As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world . "	insufficient181	1	This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study . For example , suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family . If you would like to attend a business school , you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university . He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community ' s university . 	181	2	Undoubtedly , the university will have to hire professors , employees and etc . Thus , a number vacant positions need to be filled . Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community . Moreover , when people have jobs , they will have money to spend on goods and services . This can also help stimulate the local economy . 	181	3	However , building the university may lead to some social problems . A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university . When many people congregate in one place , I think that some kinds of social problems will follow . Traffic may worsen . More wastes have to be managed . Maybe crime rate will also increase . These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community . 	182	1	First , making college education free would cost too much . It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth . There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools . In addition , it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education . Consequently , it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds . 	182	2	"Second , it is a personal choice to go to a college . Not everyone wants to go to a college . People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education . Therefore , those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government . "	182	3	Third , there are many ways to fund a college education . People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds . In addition , the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means . They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students . They also provide funds for academic research . While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial . 	183	1	First of all , since people watch television too much , they can be isolated from others . Children , for example , pay more attention on movies , music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others . Gradually , their friends leave them behind either activities or studying . 	insufficient183	2	Secondly , with the rapid change of the standard of life , each family has three or four TV in each room is more common . Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room . As a consequence , children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents . Moreover , parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children . In this way , communication between family members is visibly destroyed . 	183	3	Last but not least , watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human . For example , watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing . What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does ? is this one of the reason cause division in society ? 	insufficient184	1	First , attending a live football match is very fulfilling . Before the match starts , thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags , colorful outfits , sound of trumpets and rattles . . . everywhere . As the game kicks off , the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting . You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40 , 000 people at the stadium , such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home . Everybody yells and sings together , the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored . See , you will be bored if you are watching it alone . 	184	2	"Second , watching a live football game is an exceptional experience . You can watch it at home , but "" easy come , easy go "" , you will quickly forget it , like a movie . The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive , but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game . You can cherish your experience for a long time . Furthermore , it can be an exclusive experience . If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy , you will be "" on site "" to witness and celebrate the victory . "	185	1	Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	insufficient185	2	"Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . "	insufficient185	3	"Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . "	insufficient186	1	First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	186	2	Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life . 	186	3	Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct . 	187	1	Person ' A ' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method . In other words , he is not jumping into the foreign country . Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language . Besides , all the learners are probably from the same country , so all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way . 	187	2	On the other hand , when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives . He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country . No doubt , it leads to better understanding of language essential skills . He also has access to the most up-to-date language . Thus he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to . 	187	3	On the whole , if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice . There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language . When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible . 	188	1	Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier . As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year , it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school . In addition , exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular , higher blood and cholesterol issues . 	188	2	Daily exercise will help also to develop children ' s brain function . It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better . When people exercise , the respiratory system ' s function is enhanced , helping all organs , including the brain , to get more oxygen in . Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners . 	188	3	"Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine . Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity ; however , they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice . Moreover , they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life . "	189	1	A student has to do lots of studies in today ' s competitive world to prove himself . He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades . If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time , then it would cause an extra burden on them . Furthermore , jobs has various responsibilities like attendance , sometimes extra work and so on . This would result in stress , tension and tiredness . They won ' t be able to get proper time for relaxation , sleep . Thus , would affect their mental and physical health . 	189	2	Another reason , jobs can divert students from their studies . If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money . They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money . This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies . Moreover , they drop out their studies so as to earn more money . 	189	3	In addition to this , the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time . He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends , clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others . They have whole life to do job and prove themselves , but the childhood phase will never return in their life . Therefore , they should take advantage of life as much possible they can . 	190	1	Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	190	2	On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	191	1	When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	insufficient191	2	Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	191	3	When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	192	1	The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	192	2	Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	192	3	Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	192	4	When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	193	1	The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out . Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move . If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly . Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person . 	193	2	The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution . Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on . They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer . The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air . If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted . The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy . 	193	3	The use of public transportation make us live more sociable . When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society . When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life . 	194	1	Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	194	2	In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	insufficient195	1	First of all , my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture . Most of these lands are left without any treatment . The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land . This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land . Especially , if they have no knowledge or education in this field . 	195	2	Secondly , the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve . The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part . The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products . For example , the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country . The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product , how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms . 	195	3	Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs . Obviously , showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money . 	195	4	Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field . For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business , but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction , and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that . 	196	1	First of all , learning by doing things develops our maturity . When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself . You will not be in need to refer to books or persons . The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity . For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation . We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading . 	insufficient196	2	Secondly , learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about . There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them . Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing . People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming . Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming . 	insufficient196	3	Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things . With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring . Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things . So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them . 	197	1	It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	197	2	On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	198	1	First , the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation . Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non-renewable resource . Therefore , the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up . In the contrary , if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower . And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline . 	198	2	Second , public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems . Averagely , public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars . It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes . 	198	3	Last but not least , using public transportation is much safer than private transportation . According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care . Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting . 	199	1	Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons . For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone . I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all . Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing . In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone . 	insufficient199	2	Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone . For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent . Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future . Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful . 	insufficient200	1	"People are corrupting their ecosphere . In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a "" new "" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . "	200	2	Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	200	3	"Also , people are endangering other species ' live . Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . "	201	1	First , conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history . According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association , we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed , which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered . What ' s more , rising sea levels , caused by global warming , have reached a level that is threatening human ' s life in many countries . If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms . In short , the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn ' t take harsh measures now , we never will . 	201	2	"Furthermore , supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually . Nowadays , an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation ; therefore , sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising . Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment , then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society . "	201	3	Finally , conservation leads us to a higher standard of living . I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings , but , with exhaust fumes and acid rain , we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs . Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art . 	202	1	The co-workers should be cooperative with one another . If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes . I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious . Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not . Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person . However , one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor . When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse . From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility . Therefore , I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment . 	insufficient202	2	The co-workers need to trust each other . They should not act on suspicion . This is a very important aspect in the work environment . I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me . To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him . However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me . But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department . 	insufficient203	1	First , if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk . Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way . If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment . Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal . In my personal experience , all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck . And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals . 	insufficient203	2	Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . In other words , those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination . They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal . If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery . He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery . However , up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened . 	insufficient203	3	Thirdly , if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target . For example , my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion . He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion . He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors . Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply . At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity . 	insufficient204	1	First , the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying . Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class . Consequently , the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas . Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends . 	204	2	Second , classroom learning provides other activities than studying . During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library . These activities lead to more interact with their friends . Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities , furthermore , they have a chance to learn about their societies . While the online course keeps the children at their home only . 	204	3	Lastly , in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice . The professor provides good answers to you . They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem . In contrast , in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important . The professor has been assigned to teach only . Moreover , there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question . 	205	1	Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . So an optional attendance saves time and money . 	205	2	Secondly , some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook . This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic . By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching . Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently . 	205	3	In addition , being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life . Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning . With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency . Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas . 	205	4	Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being . However , in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims . By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves . These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time . 	206	1	Firstly , the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items . One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits . Regardless of some exceptions , it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities . 	206	2	Secondly , another advantage of small towns is living costs . Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities . Therefore , in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes , also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services . Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money . 	207	1	To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas . Obviously , many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career . Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living . For example , if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time . 	207	2	However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities . As a result , cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation . Additionally , it might put strain on the environment . If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution . 	208	1	For the primary concern , it can provide students a sense of direction in academy . Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss . That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation . Finally , students may study harder for their economic dreams . 	208	2	On the other hand , economy is always correlate with politics , students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks . Besides , there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises , students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid . 	208	3	In addition , the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college . They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students . That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible . 	209	1	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	209	2	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	209	3	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	210	1	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	210	2	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	insufficient211	1	To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects . If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ‰Ûª health . For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes . Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ‰Ûª s health , it will also decrease their learning capability . 	211	2	In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people . It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically . Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit . Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life . 	211	3	Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents . However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents . Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills . 	212	1	On one hand , it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs . When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures . The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture . For example , if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual , full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture . As a result , people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country . 	insufficient212	2	On the other hand , keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination . When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country . The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society . One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969 . They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it . While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working . Although being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination . Their houses and private cars were buried by local people , because the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs . If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated . 	insufficient213	1	Of course , effective cooperation can make things easier and faster , but in many important cases when team-working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help . The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working . Let ' s imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people , but you have no experience of working alone , standardized tests such as SAT , TOEFL may be your nightmares . Testing is a very important aspect of life , and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team . Therefore , if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own . 	insufficient213	2	Moreover , the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people . Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas . Everybody in a team must have his / her own opinion first , then discuss them with other members . When we work in team , we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate . When everyone in a team can come up with his / her own ideas , working in team will definitely more effective . 	214	1	First of all , although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health . It is generally believed that , the second-hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself . For example , if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked . This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it . Therefore , smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health . 	214	2	Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them , the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience . The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals . This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences . 	214	3	Lastly , smoking does no good to the smoker himself . Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation . This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity , because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior . At this point , the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader . 	insufficient215	1	First , having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit . Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze , so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted . My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company . He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise . When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend , he made up his mind to loose weight . He started to jog every morning . After a moth , he is thinner and finds a girlfriend . 	insufficient215	2	"Also , doing something for a long time can be boring , having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind . For example , at school , students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class . Humans are not robots ; we can ' t keep working for twenty-four hours . Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries . "	215	3	Last , we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured . Playing musical instrument is a good way , I can play classical guitar . When I meet difficulties in studies , I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves . It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence . 	insufficient216	1	First and foremost , we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents . The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia . Moreover , the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing . Most importantly , there are many accidents happening on the roads . For example , in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents . Each year , Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan . 	insufficient216	2	Secondly , investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work . Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads . For instance , I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home . It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour . In contrast , if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions . 	insufficient216	3	Last but not least , spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality . All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes . Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried . We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities . What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier . 	217	1	On one hand , the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter . Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life . And friends , people who are the same generation with you , they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you , which is not . By listening to your family and friends advice , you can definitely avoid many unexpected things . 	217	2	On the other hand , finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature . For one thing , there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don ' t experience it by yourself . For example , a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous . If you did as he told , you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely . In addition , family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time . You will grow to be dependent and reliant . In contrast , free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose . 	insufficient217	3	According to myself , both ways are good , but I prefer the latter . It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable . I believe that experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice . Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves , why don ' t the younger try to do the same ? 	insufficient218	1	First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood . They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future . They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy . A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping . For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood . Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned . Also , people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy . 	insufficient218	2	Second , childhood is the period where people go to school and learn . Therefore , school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life . There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun . For example , my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years . Moreover , he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories . 	insufficient219	1	First of all , people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming . For instance , such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job . On the other hand , more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts . 	219	2	At the second point , since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home . People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like . More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before . This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases . 	220	1	First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents . The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age . When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown . If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together . All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by . Thus , I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile . 	220	2	Furthermore , living at home costs less than living outside . Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home . Therefore , he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents . Moreover , another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings . Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be . In a word , the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer . 	220	3	The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother ' s suggestions . When in dilemma , the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand . They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way . If the parents do not help him immediately , he would have to suffer more pain . Hence , taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily . 	221	1	First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge . When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning . The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically . They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features . Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class . Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals . 	221	2	Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats . In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest . They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves . Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife . 	221	3	Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction . There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely . If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money . That also make money flow , and then economics become better . It benefits to a certain country . 	222	1	First , children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents . As a baby , they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents . Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that . Consequently , parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind . 	222	2	Second , parents train their child how to become a good person . They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way . On the one hand , it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person . On the other hand , children are shown how to behave well with others . This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children ' s behavior better before they face the real world . 	222	3	Third , it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children . Thus , they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children . Unlike a professional , parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life . In fact , parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life . 	223	1	First of all , television has useful and educational programs . Not only the up-to-date news , but also there are many programs which has educational purposes . If children can use those programs wisely , they can learn many information from it . For example , in Korea , there ' s program called EBS . It is targeted for children to teenager . We can study subjects through EBS lecture . Also , there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea . Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects . 	insufficient223	2	In addition , Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses . There are many Tv programs such as sports programs . Many children have a lot of stresses recently , since they have so much pressure about study . When they are watching sports programs , it ' s easy to relieve those stresses . As an example , I got too much stress from the school . So , I was quite aggressive , however . After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan , the stress was gone . Instead , this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school , since it helped me to relieve my stress . 	insufficient224	1	First and foremost , various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish . The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job , but regularly give out creative and novel ideas . What ' s more , the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge . Therefore , the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards . More importantly , they have activeness , inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly . These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not . 	224	2	Secondly , the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time . At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life . Thereafter , the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also . Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones . The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed , so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise . 	224	3	Last but not least , the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment . In my opinion , the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue . It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living . Furthermore , the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas . 	225	1	Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives . We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave . Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community . But during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to . Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult . 	225	2	Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day . Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you . There are lots of new facts you can learn , stories you can listen to and things you can see . Therefore , childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most . 	225	3	Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child . Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination . In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries , therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination . 	226	1	First of all , the predecessors ' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past . As everyone ' s life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare , we all should learn about other ' s mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones . Each mistake , from the smallest to the bigger one , is a treasure of experience , which , if we can make full use of , will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life . Therefore , past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times . 	226	2	"Secondly , people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes . If the predecessors ' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals , others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way . By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets , we have the chance to make those mine , put them into practice and , of course , be successful like them . For instance , Edison ' s statement "" Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration "" is still helpful for everyone today , and probably in the future . "	insufficient226	3	Last but not least , the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions . If it had not been for those knowledge in the past , we could never be as modern as today . How can America be the world ' s leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India . How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth ' s gravity without the apple which fall on Newton ' s head . They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us . We cannot ignore them in any way . 	insufficient227	1	Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living . In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now . In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity . Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets . 	227	2	Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war . In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles . In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union . Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other . As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries . 	228	1	First , it ' s true watching TV take a lot of your day , nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs . 	228	2	Second , people like having meals while they are watching TV . Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends . For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights . It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema . 	insufficient228	3	"Third , TV can be one of communication ways . Moreover , TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV , WDTV using Skype , tango and other apps . In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends ; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV . "	229	1	First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . Anybody does not remember mistakes . If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	insufficient229	2	Second , Everybody makes mistake . However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	230	1	First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	insufficient230	2	Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	231	1	Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game , but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did . My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day . We did play video-games , but that wasn ' t our main activity . In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do . 	insufficient231	2	I have a friend that grew up in the countryside . He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university . This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology . 	insufficient232	1	Firstly , the things that parents say have great power to their child . More power than any friend or other adult could have . For example , if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong . 	insufficient232	2	Secondly , a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people , so their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else . They have more contact and more intimacy with their children . 	232	3	Lastly , children usually mirror themselves on their parents . That ‰Ûª s as important thing because even if the parents don ‰Ûª t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves . So , if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad . 	233	1	Firstly , people normally have lots of things to do . Because of that , they don ‰Ûª t have much time to spend in the kitchen . But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome . For example , if an engineer needs to make a project , but he needs to deliver it tomorrow , he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch . 	insufficient233	2	Secondly , when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food . For example , if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend , he could just buy some food that comes with instructions . Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time . 	insufficient234	1	Firstly , standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students . For example some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue . Therefore , exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students . In addition , many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class , so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them . 	insufficient234	2	Additionally , standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice . Since , some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard , so they will never try to solve problems on their own . However , standardized tests offer them such chance . Thus , it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides . 	234	3	Finally , I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice , since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students . In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively . I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don ‰Ûª t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them . 	235	1	University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . In today ‰Ûª s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . 	235	2	Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	236	1	A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject . He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him / herself forward all the time . And then he or she can do better in teaching works . For instance , the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading . He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves . All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher . 	insufficient236	2	As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers . But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted . If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity . In addition , a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time . He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions . That is good for both of the professor and students . 	236	3	Finally , all professors in the university are fortune of the society . They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on . Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly . Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing . Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth . 	237	1	There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television . Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas . It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people ‰Ûª s health . Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods . In turn , people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases . 	237	2	Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children . They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies . When people are watching television or movies together , they also talk less to each other , compare to when playing social games , such as parlor games , together . 	237	3	Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements . These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images . When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements , they think that they are ugly . Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body . When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him , then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don ‰Ûª t prefer it . 	238	1	The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place , as I said back . And also taking the chance for making friends . Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations . And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you . 	238	2	However , other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip . My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum , it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works , and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums . 	insufficient239	1	First of all , a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression . Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible . For example , I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers . In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other . Finally , I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job . 	insufficient239	2	Secondly , people will get respect from politeness within each other . Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need . A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure . There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed , because from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity . 	239	3	Finally , the society needs a civilized environment and orders . And a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities . In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners . Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate . 	240	1	To start with , hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc . People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end . As a result , experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time . 	240	2	What ' s more , people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles . Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties , they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens . Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way . 	241	1	Firstly , in the city there is much better education system . This means , that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places . 	241	2	In addition , I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside . There are not only more jobs , but they are also well-paid . Of course living in a city is more expensive , but incomes are higher too . 	241	3	Moreover , in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge . Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits . 	241	4	Furthermore , the city has well-organised lines of transport . The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside , so the city provides better communication . 	241	5	However , in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location . Moreover , peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness . 	242	1	Admittedly , job can bring us happiness . People can receive a sense of values and respected from job . If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self-confidence . In addition , job can provide money to us . 	242	2	However , people should concern more about their living environment than job . First , for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives . Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years . For example , Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day . These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work . 	insufficient242	3	Second , beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people . Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety . Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly . Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil . In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests . In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people . Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories , they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases . 	insufficient243	1	Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . You can talk to others from thousands mile . For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	insufficient243	2	In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	insufficient243	3	Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	insufficient244	1	"To begin with , television shows make people forget what is really important . One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air . Thus , they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives . One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show "" Infinete Challenges "" . This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other . That is , watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us . "	insufficient244	2	Moreover , even when people watch television together , there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television . Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone . Thus , it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness . To illustrate my point , it is reported that most of people don ' t converse with their family when they are watching television together . It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don ' t require any participation . 	245	1	Firstly , communicating by e-mail is easy . Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with . In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident . 	245	2	Secondly , you can write an e-mail at any time of the day . As for me , I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day . I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems . I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail . 	insufficient245	3	Thirdly , when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself . For example , you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite . When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail . 	245	4	And finally , there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail . You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business . 	246	1	For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . 	insufficient246	2	In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . 	246	3	Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . 	247	1	Firstly , people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages . For example in relationships . Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle . From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city . I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away . Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today . Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship . 	insufficient247	2	In addition , cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home . Furthermore , they are more flexible . My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money . He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend . If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms . 	insufficient247	3	Finally , the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world . If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life . They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas . There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car . As a result , people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world . 	248	1	First of all , as parents are involved in the same environment , they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry-related information . For example , my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge . Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting . Because he has many experiences , I could save enormous time in finding solution . This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues . If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now . 	insufficient248	2	Nevertheless , since parents have worked in tens of years , they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry . They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children . For instance , they know which company has better welfare or provides better education . Moreover , their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies . It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society . When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process . 	248	3	Some may argue that as time is different , the condition of job market is completely different . Therefore , choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision . I agree with this opinion to some extent , but when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly . The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash , so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more . 	249	1	First of all , children generally have weak self-control , and thus they lose their time easily . Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents . I , in my childhood , was just a typical case . Whenever I back to home from school , the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours . I could watch TV for hours , but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes . I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing , but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook . I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying . 	insufficient249	2	Moreover , sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children . Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad , therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity . Recently , more and more children smoke because they imitate actors ' behaviors on TV or movies . What ' s even worse , according to some statistics , there are more and more children have violent tendency , and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies . It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health . How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors ? 	249	3	Admittedly , in concerning the social relationship with peers , some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation . I agree with this viewpoint to some extent . However , it doesn ' t mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching . 	250	1	First of all , a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career . Therefore , those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways . They are not paid for no reason . As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment . It ' s all the same in every profession . That ' s why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields , namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods . 	insufficient250	2	Second , such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances . Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they ' ve gone through and how much cost they ' ve thrown into investing themselves . They shall reap within their high salaries . In other words , if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances , there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed . 	250	3	Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair . However , in my opinion , as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his / her dreams and careers , that would be fair . Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone , but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment . 	251	1	"First , the core of group working is "" consensus "" . It ' s the idea that everyone ‰Ûª s opinion accounts . In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . "	251	2	"Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . As one Chinese idiom goes : "" The good medicine tastes bitter "" . Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . "	251	3	However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . You should have your own judgments too ! And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . 	252	1	First , it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young . Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination . Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules . They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched . Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances . Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination . 	252	2	Second , music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing . They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way . They are essential to our spiritual life . Therefore , even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure . 	252	3	However , some people might argue that parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children , since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them . In my opinion , it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like . If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much . In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills . In this way , it will not be such pressure on children . 	253	1	First of all , by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject . Take chemistry for example , merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring , while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class . While I was in senior high school , my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas . This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good . I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget , even though now I ' m not studying chemistry anymore . 	insufficient253	2	Second , by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving . This will address students ' interests because it ' s the assignment that needs real life participation . For example , in law class , students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them . When any one of the situations occurs , they can think independently and figure out how to react . 	insufficient254	1	First , environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments . All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one . Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she ' s gone . Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well . 	254	2	Second , the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues . Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems . Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together . The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator , since the rising sea water could drown them . Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth . 	254	3	Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside . They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away . However , the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now . It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages . 	255	1	First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus . For example , I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars . So , with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own . 	insufficient255	2	Second , a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world . So , with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not . For example , instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city . 	255	3	Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can ' t meet every place . Of course , it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places . However , no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet . It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health . In this way , this won ' t be a problem at all . 	256	1	First , in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams . Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students . Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements . 	256	2	Second , it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class . Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves . Many professors grade their students with class attendances . In other words , class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances . Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes . 	256	3	Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own . Why wasting time going to classes ? Doesn ' t self-study more efficient ? However , in my opinion , this is a rather immodest way of thinking . I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors . Besides , even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates . 	257	1	To begin with , famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people . Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job . I mean , when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success . For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal . Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty . But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me . It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me . Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me . He do a lot of exercise in football field every day , so it is not for which he is luckier than me . 	insufficient257	2	Moreover , we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful . I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us . So , for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question . You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky . If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam . Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam . 	insufficient257	3	Finally , you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way . The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance . These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work . Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works . 	258	1	A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier . Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available , I get discouraged after spending a lot of time . In this situation , I ' ll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her . And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused . 	258	2	There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor . For example , if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher . It ' s almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own . By the way , if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly ! For example , from my own experiences , after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher , I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo , but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits , I was able to play properly . 	insufficient258	3	There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won ' t have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes . In today ' s world there are many great and useful sources available like books , electronic books , the internet and TV and satellite . I can utilize them as tutorials for many things . For instance , I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites . 	insufficient259	1	First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly . They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together . Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss . It ' s more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone . For another example , if one ‰Ûª s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix . 	insufficient259	2	Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works . For example , people are easily distracted while working at home . It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away . In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing . Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss . 	260	1	First , being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others . As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game . Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive . If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you . Take myself for example , when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently . 	insufficient260	2	Second , being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others . In other words , once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you . Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example . The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors . It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers . It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value . 	insufficient261	1	First of all , art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful . It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures . Under this circumstance , learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures . For instance , students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven ' s most notable workpiece is played . 	insufficient261	2	In addition , studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax . Obviously , with the improvement of life rhythm , people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs , and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself . Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life . When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings , such as the Mona Lisa , people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for . At this moment , they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved . Apparently , this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art . 	insufficient261	3	Admittedly , the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student ' s own interest . The education of art and music would not work if students resist it . Thus , the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure . 	262	1	First , under globalization and industrial integration , the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging . The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world . In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage . However , as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges . For example , now there are more chances to do business with people around the world , so besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well . For another example , financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century , thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management . 	insufficient262	2	Second , this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation . The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them . In contrast , young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually . They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want . It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them . They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences . 	263	1	First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . I was in the Management Information System department . What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	insufficient263	2	Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . They majored in financing when they were in college . But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	insufficient263	3	Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ‰Ûª t success one ‰Ûª s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . In this way , it won ‰Ûª t be a problem at all . 	264	1	There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things . For example , if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places . By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future . These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can ‰Ûª t be always found in books . 	insufficient264	2	I do believe that great success requires taking great risks . If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money . If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies . The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be . If you don ‰Ûª t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes . That ‰Ûª s why it is important to take risks . 	265	1	We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job . This can be done in school . In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them . If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future . For example , if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job . As you can see , studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job . 	insufficient265	2	One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation . By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication . Commuincation can bring many benefits . For example , if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal . Or , if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers . So , relating well to people is also another important factor . 	insufficient266	1	First of all , advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit . The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self-control . It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body . However , advertising is not the only information source for people . People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines . As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations . It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors . 	266	2	Second , in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods . In other words , advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people . Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added . These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good . In these cases , the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle . 	267	1	First of all , some people spend a lot of time watching television . Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours . I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours . Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials . So , she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email . Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them . 	insufficient267	2	Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family . This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns . Also , when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them . When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases . 	267	3	Finally , some people make the television a priority . I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night . Honestly , I was in shock ! How she could say that to me ? . 	insufficient268	1	First , in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports . For example , my roommate , Mary , always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory . When she gets to the dorm , she is really full of energy and after taking a shower , she is ready to start a good day . As you see , she is doing exercise without spending a cent . What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus , inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health . 	insufficient268	2	In addition , students choose their major based on their interests . The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students . Because their major in completely involved in physical activities . In contrast , for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories , because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field . 	268	3	Finally , spending money on social activities looks like wasting money . For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people , university programs are the last place they would choose . For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other , we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people . 	insufficient269	1	First of all , friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career . Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job . Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields , imagine when you are in trouble , you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you , so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible , even an esy phone call , instend of a series of complex solutions . 	269	2	Futuermore , no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company , relating well to people is also a importent issue . If top-level managers want to make a project successful , have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers ' work complete successfully , managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job , pay much patiant and care to them . Consequently , make a good relationship with them . 	269	3	On the other side , if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss , only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss ' s eyes , he will be more possible to enhance position . 	269	4	However , someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job . Studying harder in school , getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge , which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job . But imagine it , a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people , and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former , which person do you want to be ? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future . 	270	1	First of all , great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive . Take myself as an example , I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam , submitting my paper , and finishing my internship work at the end of each term . Yet , in this year , following the suggestion of my roommate , John , I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control . This plan ability helps me a lot , making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else . 	insufficient270	2	Equally important , the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time . As we all know , the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly . If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent . However , things have been changing all the time . For instance , the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company ' s schedule . In this case , those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired . Every employee can not afford this kind of loss . 	insufficient270	3	Finally , some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job . Thus , it is not need for young people to possess this ability . Nevertheless , this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability . As searching information on the internet , young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs . At this circumstances , they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where . It is obviously a huge waste of time . But if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination . 	271	1	First and foremost , I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college . Also , they can help each other for learning materials better . However , if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems . 	271	2	Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points . In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study . 	271	3	Finally yet importantly , appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class ‰Ûª s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments . However , the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times . Through this way , they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study . 	272	1	To begin with , telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other . Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address . I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with . For example , right now , I am in the U . S . It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country . Consequently , I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want . Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents . 	insufficient272	2	Second , using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication . For instant , sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment . So , when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion . Thus , these types of communications make me feel personal . 	insufficient273	1	There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants , museums , bars , sporting clubs , cinemas , theatre and etc . People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends . 	273	2	In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers . It ‰Ûª s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life . Better education results better career and been well paid . So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns . Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns . 	273	3	But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation , because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly . Every technology has it ‰Ûª s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology . In addition to what mentioned , medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind . 	274	1	Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal . Without doubt , the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be . For instance , Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity . Instead , he hardly cared about something else . It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because , at least for him , using two different soups properly was quite annoying . As the example above indicates , you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well . 	insufficient274	2	If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it . When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it . Then , you will motivate yourself to do more . To give an example , I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school . Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably , I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems . As a result , I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems . Thus , by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it . 	insufficient275	1	The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life , even though when we are not borne . So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues . To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood , when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked . First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished . I asked my father for extra money , but he refuse to give it to me . I found that I should manage the way that I spend money . From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted . 	insufficient275	2	Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family . If parents get the children all they wanted , they would be run out of their money for their essential needs . Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity . As a case in point , I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family , his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood . He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money . His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life , but unfortunately it was useless . Finally one night , having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car , he crashed a truck and died . Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property , but also bring sorry to his family . 	insufficient276	1	First , dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe . For example , some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life . Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced , the rain would come . Consequently , dancing are the part of people belief . 	insufficient276	2	Secondly , dancing can represent to civilization of that culture . For instance , I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom , king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture . The way of movement , the way that they costume and also a music while they dance . All this is a civilization of their culture . 	insufficient276	3	Thirdly , many culture , people have many ways to entertain themselves . And dancing is one of that ways . Both people who see and dance also have a good time . For example , many event , such as christmas , last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts , and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song . I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy . 	insufficient277	1	First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	277	2	Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	277	3	Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	278	1	First , besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness . In my viewpoint , our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly . As a case in point , last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back . After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted . Therefore , I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ! As a result , sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health . 	insufficient278	2	Second , besides the academic knowledge , the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human ' s life . As a practical epitome , students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation . Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment . In my opinion , social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment . So , social activities have same rights to receive monetary support . 	278	3	Moreover , they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments . If we follow just one wing of my life i . e . , studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation . Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends . In my perspective , more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me . 	279	1	First of all , everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives . Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people . For example , a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet . 	insufficient279	2	In addition , people can gain more knowledge by using the internet , the most useful technology in the world . Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge . Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge . For instance , people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it . 	insufficient279	3	Last but not least , The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing . This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet . They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places . Moreover , people can learn other countries ' s culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations . 	280	1	First of all , when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities . This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all . For example , pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music . Therefore , requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them . 	insufficient280	2	In addition , people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one . Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study . For instance , university students who study business are also know history of the world . Furthermore , students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers . Hence , they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another . 	insufficient280	3	Finally , students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career . This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer . For example , students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include . Moreover , bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge . 	281	1	First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . Then , many people did not have money . When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . So that , government should invest to create more jobs . When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . Therefore , criminal rate were drop . Thus , people have a good quality life . 	281	2	Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . These impact on every living creature in the world . So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	281	3	Lastly , family is a root of society . If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	282	1	First of all , listening to music is a great way to relax . For example , when I go to office , I use public transport . I see many things such as traffic jam , crowded people at bus stop , and all so crowded people in buses . These make me stress . So that I always listen music from my mp3 player . I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me . Consequently , I feel happy when I listen music . 	insufficient282	2	Second , another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise . For instance , I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time . These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress . Thus , after work , I always do exercise , and jogging is my favorite sport . I feel that after working out , I am easily to fall asleep . Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health . 	insufficient282	3	Third , meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress . when I have many things to think about , and this make me stress , I will do meditation . Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment , and it take few minutes . A way to do meditation is that I just sit down , close my eyes , and count my breath . These could relieve me from stress . 	insufficient283	1	To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know . 	283	2	Second , learning abilities in each students is different . It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . Therefore , testing result are different . This problems depend on how hard study they do . It is not teachers fault . Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get . 	283	3	Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . That is problem in quality of education . Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . This problem should not be happened . Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher . 	284	1	First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . Then we will feel less interested in them . But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . I don ‰Ûª t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . So we can ‰Ûª t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs . 	insufficient284	2	Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . They will be misleading by those movies . And they may act like good people in order to get reward . Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding . 	284	3	In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . Some people may be encouraged to do good things . But like I said , this kind of behavior won ‰Ûª t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends . 	285	1	To begin with , learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt . Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example . For example , in biology class , learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits . Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog . Unlike classroom , online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation . 	insufficient285	2	Secondly , online class could not provide knowledge about social skills . For instance , In a classroom , teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group . This could help students to learn how to deal with people , how to collaborate with people in their group . This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes . 	285	3	Lastly , learning in classroom , student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body . Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way . If student do it by themselves , they might be hurt themselves . This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide . 	286	1	To begin with , studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems . For example , in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step . Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem . I could adapt this method to use my real life . When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination . Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time . I could find a better way to solve problems . 	286	2	Secondly , Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself . For instance , reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy . Thus , I am always buy a quality food such as organic food . This food are not have chemical . So that , I can have a good health . This experience teach me to aware my health . 	insufficient286	3	Lastly , experiences are also change to plan for my future life . For example , I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life . Consequently , I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life . This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life . 	287	1	To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	287	2	Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	insufficient288	1	At first , it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train . Hence , people will have more ways to go to a place . Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community , It makes people in this area have no choice . They must take only a bus to go to another place . If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them . For example , people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule . On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus . Also , this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly . 	288	2	Secondly , the buses provide merely two routes in this community . It is absolutely a major problem . For example , if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus . Obviously , it is waste of time . They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily . 	288	3	Lastly , having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars . Also , it provides many advantages . For instance , people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive . The necessary energy will slowly be used up , since people use less their own cars . 	insufficient289	1	To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance . For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product . Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information . Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give . Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance . 	289	2	Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality . Teachers could augment their quality . Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality . For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high . Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students . 	insufficient289	3	Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students . Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance . Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily . As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life . 	290	1	First , to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company . Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries . For example , if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there . In other words , Large company equals more job opportunity . 	insufficient290	2	Second , I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one . The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success . In other words , this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees . For instance , common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company . 	290	3	Third , I love travelling around the world . large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people . As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops . 	291	1	First of all , many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students . The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money . College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time . They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students . Consequently , mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university . 	291	2	On the other hand , there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education . Of course , higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try . Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change . With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future . Thus , mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university . 	292	1	First and foremost , a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined . An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week , while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days . Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games , because of their low control ability . 	insufficient292	2	Second , children could learn nothing from these computer games , therefore time on this activity is really time wasting . Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children , majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students . However , those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths . 	292	3	Admittedly , there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career . But we have to realize the fact : majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying , sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games . It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar , and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar . 	293	1	Firstly , team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently . Obviously , discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails . An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity . The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email . The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one . The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other . 	insufficient293	2	Secondly , work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members . Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official , therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing . While if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim . Therefore , less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members . 	293	3	Admittedly , sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place . Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none . Since it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas . 	294	1	First of all , doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors . Universities are relatively fenced environment . The research projects provide communication with the outside . In addition , by doing research , professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies . I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college . He was often invited to do speech in other universities . Although my university is not in the high-ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects . The research projects like windows opened to the wider world . 	insufficient294	2	Secondly , professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities . It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus . Also , you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together . Consequently , there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages . We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin . Universities positively contribute the professors ' success . 	insufficient294	3	Last but not least , doing research could also improve the teaching quality . With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom . They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice . I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project . By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments . The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching . 	insufficient295	1	Firstly , The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies . In other words , when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out , that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly . In addition , professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge , and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study . They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages . Hence I , in my class , often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem , and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher . 	insufficient295	2	Secondly , in my mind , the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself . Furthermore , the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction . Moreover , This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree . knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened . 	296	1	Of course , new technologies are always great . However , it takes time for people to adapt them . Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	insufficient296	2	Next , technology destroys the language . Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	insufficient297	1	First , indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes . In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates , because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better . For example , When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects . Finally I got 1st rank in final exam . 	insufficient297	2	Second , in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time . It makes you perfect in time management skills . Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others . It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career . 	297	3	"Third , professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills . You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts . In result you learn quickly . For example , I have my personal experience . For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster . "	insufficient297	4	It ' s undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary , but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning . 	298	1	The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job . Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words . For example , when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year . As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . Moreover , I learn money management . When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop . From this i learned , how to manage money correctly . This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things . 	insufficient298	2	Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents . For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it . Moreover , after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents . As you can see , part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially . 	insufficient299	1	First of all , it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities . In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge . But with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country . For example , in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french , german etc . 	insufficient299	2	Second , colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum . Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university . So , it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country . Also , highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges . 	299	3	Third , technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country . A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages . 	300	1	Firstly , several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low . Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student ' s get relief form exam pressure . However , research done by universities proves that student ' s performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning , preparation and examination schedule . Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester . Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course . 	300	2	Secondly , scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students ' performance after break . It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation . To quote an instance , in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams . During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes . I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game . During my all vacations , I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter . 	insufficient301	1	Firstly , committing to our goal helps creating personal worth . For example , I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard . Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running . 	insufficient301	2	Secondly , one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger . I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line . However , I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself . I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger . 	insufficient301	3	Thirdly , at some point , we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on . I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying . When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself . He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal . 	insufficient302	1	First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . Some of them had no own savings . They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	insufficient302	2	In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	insufficient302	3	Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	insufficient303	1	First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . 	insufficient303	2	In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . 	insufficient303	3	Finally , quality takes time . When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . 	insufficient304	1	First , the natural diversity is very important for further generations . If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet . As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem . To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland . If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct . As a result , further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals . 	insufficient304	2	In addition , a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather . Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming . This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes . For example , recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average . This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate . 	305	1	To begin with , going to classes are sometimes waste of the time . For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . It was waste of the time . Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book . Moreover , with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources . For example , from the Internet , students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently . However , some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way . When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time . 	insufficient305	2	Additionally , mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures . Besides , most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time . Students need to work as part time basis . Hence , they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time . At the same time , rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth . From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them . 	306	1	First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler . With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle . Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times . 	306	2	Second , technology also makes teaching simpler . In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers . With the advent of iPads in e-learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once . 	insufficient306	3	Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated . For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications . For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them . In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones . Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired . 	insufficient307	1	One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	307	2	"Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like "" Big Brother "" . "	308	1	I was born and grew up in here , a small town . In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun . Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships . If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible . Nowhere else can give me some people like in here . 	308	2	I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here . We have large streets but few cars , so we can move easily to anywhere . Last week , I went to the city center to meet my friends . The traffic in the city was too crowed . I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house . 	insufficient308	3	I also love the environment in here . I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time , and I realize that the environment in some place isn ' t clean and fresh like my home town . There were a lot of people so the environment can ' t be keep clean . 	309	1	On the one hand , living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university . For instance , students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club . Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates . In addition , it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers . I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students . 	309	2	On the other hand , living off campus prepares students for the real life . For example , students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co-operative compared to living in university dormitories . They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills . In addition , students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher . Furthermore , students also have a chance to know about the community around them . Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation . 	310	1	To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study . Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter . If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace . For example , I have a friend who was working so slowly . He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him . My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working . 	insufficient310	2	Most importantly , people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased . If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money . This fact pushes them to work faster and faster . For example , because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money , I am working in two organization to gain more salary . The more money , the more chances . 	insufficient310	3	Last but not least , people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks . If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks . If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder . It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation . Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money . 	311	1	Firstly , the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject . For example , I love Physics . But I don ' t like electronics , because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world . And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics . But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics . And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics , I could not pass the entire part of physics , and I will fail the exam over and over again . Luckily , in our university , you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach . And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics . And at last , I took the electronics again and pass the exam . 	insufficient311	2	Secondly , if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated . If one fail most of the exam , it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes . And the students will have nothing to do in the campus . Then he or she will play online games days and nights . The academic achievement will decline . In the end , this student will become a loser in the world . And all this is due to that the university don ' t permit them to attend the class . This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system . 	311	3	Admittedly , the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not . But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points . 	312	1	To begin with , the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors . I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively . By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment . A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer . Thus , students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning . That is to say , students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve . Thus , the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation . In my school , the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby . For me , I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment . It ' s unpleasant to stay at school . However , coffee shops are not always quiet , so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly . 	insufficient312	2	Besides , the ultimate purpose is to change , to motivate students to be better . To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate . In addition , will the university filter all the professors overall ? Some professors don ' t deserve the money at all , then , what ' s the point to spend money on them ? High-salary instructors don ' t teach students harder because they earn more money . There won ' t be any effect if school does so . There was news about raising professors ' salary in my country . This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly . The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries . As you can see , if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen . 	insufficient313	1	First , pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are . Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone . We can talk to them because they listen to us , more than some people will ever do . To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important . Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way . Since I was all alone at home for a long time , my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings . Clearly , although pets aren ' t able to speak with us , we can nonetheless count on them . 	insufficient313	2	Secondly , pets are useful for a variety of things . For example , nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before . Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses . There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone . In addition , pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better . Moreover , there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs . 	insufficient314	1	Primarily , even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy . Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy . If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes , we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline . In short , it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless . It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it . Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times , but with consistent work soon enough we ' ll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work . 	314	2	Secondly , other than the importance of accuracy , the world also seeks efficiency , which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality . Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients . We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made . This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start . 	314	3	Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all , for instance , in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic . A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars . In such circumstances , even when the scientists want to finish off quickly , but they couldn ' t miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems . 	insufficient315	1	First of all , I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive , living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world . Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day , let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for . For me , this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant , slow paced life styles of small towns . 	315	2	Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants ' lives , hospitals , advanced medical facilities can satisfy one ' s need of medical safety . Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one ' s and widen his horizons , things which aren ' t offered by small towns . 	315	3	Furthermore , it ' s undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it ' s big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities . With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does , and higher income can be the basis of a happier , healthier life . 	316	1	"Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need . People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in . If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class . Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government . Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency . And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this , because only a government of the people , by the people , for the people will finally last ; people ' s cohesiveness will be promoted . "	316	2	Otherwise , another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation . Build a new building has following prerequisites , land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures , a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor . Except these , hundreds of problems would occur during the construction . Thus , only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness . 	317	1	The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	insufficient317	2	All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . No known scientist has success in first attempt . Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	insufficient317	3	Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	insufficient318	1	"Capitalism enfranchised people ' s right to own properties , and consequently , their rights to use them . Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so , and accordingly , charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction . From another point of view , traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban ; so it is out of drivers ' control . Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time ? Wars are notorious , but you can ' t blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries . "	318	2	"Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear . Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous . Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance , and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights . "	318	3	Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil . Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways . In these cases , the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers . Simply put , charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful . 	319	1	"First , there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university . Because most people they contact with are also students . However , when students do part-time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults . So , they can teach students many things about adult life . My friend Lisa , who is doing part-time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it . Through part-time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life . For example , Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work . Hence , thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life . "	insufficient319	2	"Second , parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life . However , because we do not experience it , it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be . Therefore , we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be . Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job . Therefore , the part-time job can make people understand future life better . "	319	3	Third , some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student ' study . Actually , most students will do the part-time job in their holiday , so it will not effect on their study . Compared with playing computers every day , doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday . 	320	1	To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people . Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people . Therefore , my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper . 	320	2	"Furthermore / moreover , working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork . In other words , I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding . These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time . About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game . To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own "" team "" I gained a victory . "	321	1	First , time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life . By having my own business , I can manage my own time . I could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay . I can arrange time to travel when I would like . In addition , I can work long hours for earning more money . Totally , the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free . 	321	2	Moreover , earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work . The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job . If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply . Therefore , I never have been rich in my life , because my salary is not dramatically changed . In spite of many problems of having own business , I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas . 	322	1	"Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . "	322	2	Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	323	1	Firstly , parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life . As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating . Moreover , when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives . 	323	2	Secondly , at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages , but after school we learn from our parents . In my opinion , we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school . I think when we leave school , maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life , but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day . For example , I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me . 	insufficient323	3	Thirdly , I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally . Therefore , even when we grow older , get married and then have our own families with spouses and children , parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life . For instance , my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life , he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice . 	insufficient324	1	"Most of workers have adapted to do same task . It allows us to achieve more . As a authoritative dentist in my province , my mother has worked for 25 years . Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India , finally he became the father of the nation . These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time . While when it comes to "" happier "" , different type of jobs can be responsible factor . "	insufficient324	2	Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier . Workers , who work for an ordinary company or industry , will be sick of same tasks day by day . Although they can be familiar with their job , changing of job is what serve to their happier . Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment , which , according to psychology theories , makes workers relaxed and happier . To set another example , consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work , employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits . They both will be happy because the change of job , not the same task day by day . 	324	3	Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges , making life colorful . Just like a song , if I did not have challenge , life would be blue . As an engineering researcher , I will surely be disappointed for failure , and exited for new challenges . New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works , it also means through dealing with it , I will obtain more knowledge and experience . As the saying of a Chinese writer , the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf , but rather there always exists new things and challenge . After all , doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden , connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life . 	325	1	Admittedly , the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job . This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates , cooperating with other workers needs this ability , too . But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating , that is , the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker , but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave . 	325	2	The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge . The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge , not a worker with outstanding communicating skill . The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company . So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge . 	insufficient325	3	Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge . Through our whole study life , undergraduate and graduate , we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job , just like an old Chinese scholar said , the essence of study is utilizing it . After we get a job , the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture , but in making us excellent and totally master this job . Finally , we will be rewarded with pride . That ' s why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge . 	326	1	Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers . 	insufficient326	2	Computers have an important role in social and personal life . Computers have opened up a network connection among people . This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees . 	327	1	First , the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life . Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language . They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies . It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives . By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man , we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language . 	327	2	In addition , Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World . They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes . Moreover , It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World . Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child ' s vision . Therefore , they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance . 	328	1	School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life . By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate . In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa . They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc . Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age . By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them . By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies . 	328	2	Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better . Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly . Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa . As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased . 	329	1	"Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences . In fact , life may not be easy ; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks , but in the end , it can be surprisingly wonderful . For instance , some people abandon their job , family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them . In the beginning , it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity , but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired ; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country . "	insufficient329	2	"In fact , many people are afraid to take risks and fail . It is possible to get frustrate along the way , but it is vital to never give up on your dream . To illustrate , Walt Disney , whose career is famous , had a challenging life . One of the difficulties was some of his histories , such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs , were turned down . He heard lots of "" no "" , furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination , after all what he had gone through , he never stop chasing his dreams . "	insufficient330	1	Firstly , most people ' s lives are filled with tasks that they don ' t enjoy doing . In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards to other people , there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities . For instance , housework is very difficult for me , although my husband helps me some of them , but it is my responsibility . I really don ' t like any of them , however I should do . 	insufficient330	2	Secondly , professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs . Nobody likes attending boring conferences , or working a person who isn ' t well in with anyone . I ' m a research asistant at a university , and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn ' t good at human relationships , most of the asistans don ' t enjoy to talk with him about any situation , although we have to ask about his field . 	insufficient330	3	Thirdly , doing something which an individual doesn ' t enjoy can led to enjoyment . People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don ' t really want . For example , one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don ' t like . After insisting on some of our friends , we attended , and got really enjoyable time , we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month . 	insufficient331	1	Historic buildings have intrinsic values , because they are significant symbols of a city . Old buildings are reminders of a city ' s culture and complexity . By seeing historic buildings - - whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic , people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area . For example , when somebody mentions Beijing , China ' s capital city , you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind , because it is the most remarkable sign of the city , and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing , even the entire China . Depending on the study of Capital Palace , researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture . 	insufficient331	2	Furthermore , historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds . The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded , and no rooms for people to relax themselves . However , the warmth of the materials , the heart pine , marble , or the old brick , all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace . Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful . 	331	3	Meanwhile , historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees . There are many historic buildings , such as Beijing Place , Shanghai Artist Museum , they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists . Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences , and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle . 	insufficient332	1	Living on your own is a huge financial commitment . At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job , so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent , food , utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself . So , I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income . 	332	2	Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them . Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life . Living together develops the environment of discussing adult ' s physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents . Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own , and thus missing the valuable input of their parents . 	332	3	While some critics may argue that , young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want . However , I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have . It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night , smoke or do drugs . 	333	1	To begin with , nowadays , to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever . Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present , it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete . By means of some software such as Skype , MSN , Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want . For example , in earlier times , people didn ' t leave for faraway places , because they could easily get lost . This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive . 	333	2	Further , by means of some communication tools , it has become very easy to make new friends . According to statistics , 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet . In this sense , Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends . 	333	3	However , the other side of the coin is that , by communicating via Internet or phone , we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully , because during such conversations , some of our words can make a completely different sense . As a result , the rate of divorces is increasing day by day . 	334	1	It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits . For one thing , machines are more effective than human . Not like human , machines do not need rest , which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes . For another , using machines can save company ' s money . Because machines never ask for salary , over-time pay or pension , so employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare . The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working . 	334	2	However , the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people . To start with , because of extensive of using machines , many people loss their job . Especially in large population countries , high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability . Apart from this , using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation . For example , nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing . But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware . As you can imagine , if thousands of families use dish-washing machines , how many water and how much electricity will be wasted ! 	insufficient335	1	Firstly , connecting people by email is easy and fast . In addition , World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information , which they want to know for less than 10 seconds . These are two of the benefits , why IT is useful . 	335	2	Besides , nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots , which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines , engines with integrated computers and etc . For example , before centeries , there were not washing machines , which clean your clothes , while a person do another job . 	335	3	Secondly , there are some drawbacks about this issue . Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments , for instance robots , and they will not succeed to control them . All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth . 	336	1	Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols . Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively . This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace . Therefore , children may see that this behavior is inexcusable . 	336	2	On the other hand , too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions . As recent surveys showed , inspired by the fame and wealth , children now prefer more to become an actor / actress or a sports star than it was in the past . Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable . This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media , but from the basis of their own interests . 	337	1	In the first place , spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life . In the first place , as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones , they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities . Moreover , continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children . 	337	2	"Furthermore , there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as "" Iron man "" . In those games , children are rewarded for being more violent , and this violence is repeated again and again . For instance , many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours . Therefore , the hardship of communication may be developed . "	insufficient337	3	"However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet . For instance , as lots of chatting apps available online such as "" Weichat "" , people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication . Therefore , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . "	insufficient338	1	Mentioned to societies life style , they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had . Obviousness , there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time . 	338	2	Another perspective , using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable . It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere , so they do not do much social live interactions with others . The consequence of this case made some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts . However , people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship , meet them and talk by face to face directly . 	339	1	Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently . This factor initially arises from the school , where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system , and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks . This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead , but will also restrict them in many ways . For example , MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work , and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team . 	insufficient339	2	However , those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead . Although , they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do , but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team . 	339	3	"In my opinion , though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level , but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run ; while on the contrary , co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team . "	340	1	The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely . While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions . Instead of using letters , technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient . More , even if family members who are in different countries , they also can use the Internet to connect each others , especially though the images or videos , they can feel close . Furthermore , technology is also essential for students , live in remote districts , shared the valuable natural resources with friends . 	340	2	Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology , technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network . In the past , people might have had pen friends in other countries , but now , thanks to the social networking websites , people can easily to find someone who has similar interests . Also , they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet . In this way , technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships . 	341	1	Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit . Although technology takes convenience to humankind , it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle . Instead , traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance . Meanwhile , due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy , it is more environmentally-friendly , which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change . Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values . These are important foundation of modern civilization . Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems . 	341	2	Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes . In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance , it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions . Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life , so as to make people to realize the value of them . 	342	1	A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	342	2	On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	insufficient343	1	On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	insufficient343	2	On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	insufficient344	1	"Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work . It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector . Also , the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent . For example , a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production . On the other hand , modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible . Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric "" I swear "" become "" underwear "" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me . He granted huge sums for such idea . "	insufficient344	2	"Striking contrast , labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day . In any case , a musician playing "" I swear "" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation . Moreover , government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it , art value is about taste . "	insufficient345	1	"First of all , many of us would agree to the fact that people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health . By working too long , they often become tired , lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick . Moreover , they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons . The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life . "	345	2	"Secondly , these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign . As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities . For instance , I would take my boss ' s example ; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years . Recently , his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries . He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him . "	insufficient346	1	Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working , dedication and passion . Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable . 	346	2	More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect . 	insufficient347	1	In addition , products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement , people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought . A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society . And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it . 	347	2	However , buying habit is a very personal things for individuals , the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy , sometimes it depends on one ' s needs and ability of consumption . It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income . Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase . On the other hand , children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not , since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary . 	348	1	To start with , all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government , as it is the most important source of government ' s revenue , which is mainly used to serve all citizens . For example , a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability , so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment . The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers . Although these workers do not produce profit directly , what they do is for the well-being of the whole society . 	348	2	However , I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax . As we know , there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others . It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties , but such financial help is usually far from enough . In such case , aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support . Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force . There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited . So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department . 	349	1	"Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics because these subject are necessary for students ' future . This is understandable when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification . In addition , the unemployment rate is always high , so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job . "	349	2	Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job . Firstly , studying music , art or sports is also very important to students . This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them . Secondly , to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation . For instance , through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills . Therefore , these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability . Finally , children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity . 	insufficient350	1	A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis . This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly . For example , when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident . The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth . In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media . Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two . This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines . 	insufficient350	2	People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc . For example , one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War . It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at . But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details . This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines . 	insufficient351	1	To begin with , I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well . However , aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work-place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life . People , for instance , who don ' t like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary . In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position . 	351	2	Further and even more importantly , most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach . In other words , career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary . For example , people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries . 	352	1	The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about . As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter . It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers . That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note . 	352	2	Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way . When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world . For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career . From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children . 	insufficient353	1	To begin with , children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery . Moreover , these people will not have an access to a good education . As a result , they can be proselytized into bad isms . For example , most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people , because the person with better education has a wider outlook , which will allow no brainwash . In this sense , people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms . 	insufficient353	2	Nevertheless , people who are born in well-off families have access to good education , which will have a positive impact on their later life . Secondly , children from rich families have better skills on how to use money , because they use it a lot of times . Finally , wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines , which will be very beneficial for the health of a child . For instance , many good medicines cost vast amounts of money , which cannot be afforded by poorer families . 	354	1	To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	354	2	Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	355	1	To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years . Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to . Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning . Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered . 	355	2	"Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years . The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend . In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them . In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers . Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years . It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages . "	356	1	I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment . In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats . Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels . Based on these grounds , it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged . 	356	2	However , flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy . Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment . 	356	3	Furthermore , the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well . The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably . With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing . In addition , both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations . 	357	1	To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	357	2	Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	358	1	On the one hand , the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous . For one , it helps working people to maintain work life balance . The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby . People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours . For students too , studying from home is an attractive option . They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies . In a busy city like Tokyo , students waste a lot of time in travelling . Thus , the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious . 	insufficient358	2	On the other hand , one part of the society , has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home . Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation , he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues . This harms an employee ' s deliverable . Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly . Due to this they lag in their studies . These factors affect people who work or study from home . 	359	1	There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area . Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows . Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant . 	insufficient359	2	On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions . For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place . Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries . Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties . 	insufficient360	1	It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	360	2	Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	insufficient361	1	It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information . There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings . By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities . For example , Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs . 	insufficient361	2	But on other hand , watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health . For example , they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain . Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences . Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades . 	insufficient362	1	First and foremost , old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm . The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view . The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity . For example , most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability . 	362	2	Secondly , their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life . In other words , that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology . This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery . Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment . 	362	3	Last but not least , knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly . Who would the employer choose , an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages . Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace . 	363	1	It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people . For example , in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days . People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs . It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity . So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects . 	insufficient363	2	On other side of the coin , many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work . Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens . The work of chopping , blending , grating , kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes . Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome . 	insufficient364	1	First of all , traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture . They make differences between countries . Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence . Consequently , people feel pround of their country , so they keep reserving conventions . For example , ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries . 	364	2	In addition , in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology . Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability . In paticular , vases are made by hand would be used more . Futhermore , there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method . For instance , making cone hats from leaves have to use hand . Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy . 	insufficient364	3	The last thing is about education . Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history . Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations . After that , they might create somethings that are useful for life . 	365	1	First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	365	2	Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	366	1	First of all , it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents . Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age . For example , in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes . This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals . 	insufficient366	2	Secondly , it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way . Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior . For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools . So , this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people . 	insufficient367	1	The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently . Automatically , the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people . We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers , and dealing with machines . Those activities have proven that women can also do the men ' s works . Therefore , female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men . 	367	2	Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person ' s career . These days , it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities . So , learning from human ' s history , education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college . According to this opinion , giving equal education for both men and women is a must . 	368	1	To start , non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain . Prior to 1980 ' s public places in Sri Lanka , illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely . Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit , some instances that lead to belligerent incidents . After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public . 	insufficient368	2	In addition to this , introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing . For instance , further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths , as per the ministry of health . As this shows , smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country ' s healthcare systems . 	insufficient369	1	First of all , tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be . Basically , places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas , of which economy , before their appearance , haven ' t blossmed yet . Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up . It will , by all means , attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents . In other word , tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction , which exploit the best out of its own potential . 	369	2	Secondly , even though environmental damage is inevitable , it is not tourism to be blamed for . In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction , the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration . To be precise , for instance , a fortune is spent on trimming the trees , watering the flowers , preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora , in the hope of beautifying the wild . Not to mention ecotourism , a new kind of environment-friendly service , which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures . Because of that , tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity . 	370	1	With the rapid developing pace , IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves . In the past , there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail , but the cyber world now varies form games , online TV shows to means of communication , and probably still keeps going . Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones , resulting in their dependence on technical equipment . What is more , the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict , therefore , staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative . 	370	2	Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues . The existence of Skype , Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click . As a result , rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh . Needless to say , their action will make a beeline for obesity , short-sighted , diabetes and other heart-related problems . 	371	1	Firstly , health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular . Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer . This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health . Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake , it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources . 	371	2	Secondy , relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet . Some religion , such as Buddha , believes that animals were human being in their previous life , so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings . It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . However , I am convinced that it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind . 	insufficient372	1	It is undeniable that the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life . For instance , in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts . This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed . 	insufficient372	2	In tradition , a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress . Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today . Also , study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing . 	373	1	"Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the "" legalized revenge "" to victims ' family . Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . "	373	2	"Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . "	373	3	Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . They do not undergo any pain or misery . Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . 	374	1	First of all , the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners . With zoos , pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of , for instance , a lion or a crocodile . At a higher level , it is of university students ' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings , which otherwise would not be at hand . This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels . 	374	2	Secondly , the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection . Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats , which consequently calls for the help of zoos . What is more , the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species . Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as : giraffe , panda , koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory . 	375	1	There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money . Firstly , we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them . For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials . Secondly , it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only . 	insufficient375	2	"Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages . This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication . In addition , forming a language must be undergone thousands of years ; thus , it deserves to be respected and preserved . Last but not least , language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world . Therefore , saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation . "	376	1	No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness . Children should be taught about balanced diets , nutritious food as well as harmful ones , thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle . What is more , it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of , for instance , not consuming too much fast food , over-fried food or intoxicants . 	376	2	In addition , it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases . Needless to say , such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune , not to cure , but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years . Similarly , if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product , obesity , myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance . 	377	1	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	377	2	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	377	3	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	378	1	In the first place , school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education . For instance , to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge . However , in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics . 	378	2	Furthermore , teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills . For example , after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills . By contrast , parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way . 	378	3	Last but not least , compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children . Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work , hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children . Thus , it was impossible for them to be a good teacher . 	379	1	On one hand , i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human ' basic needs . More specifically , people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication . It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably . This is because they are doing what they love , their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths . 	insufficient379	2	On the other hand , i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field . There are plenty of people , who are now really successful , have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers , dancers and painters . Besides , important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness , satisfaction of jobs , personal relationships , professional skills , working environment , managers and colleagues should not be underestimated . Finally , some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies . 	380	1	One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile . Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries . Additionally , for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities . 	380	2	However , taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation . To be precise , the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable . Consequently , people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis . 	380	3	Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially . Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them . America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil . 	insufficient381	1	First of all , we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself . As a result , criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs . Thus , citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally . Moreover , while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns . Therefore , a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one . 	381	2	Secondly , police force carries guns only in high crime societies . Hence , people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson . Obviously , Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence . 	382	1	To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds . The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields . There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide . 	insufficient382	2	Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning . The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime . Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace . Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly . 	383	1	Firstly , it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically . Air-conditioners , computers , cellphones , washing machines , for example , is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities . Moreover , applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients ' lives . 	383	2	However , some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly . In spite of bring fantastic advantages , technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process . This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously . Last but not least , technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements . 	384	1	Admittedly , reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could , to some degree , decrease the overall crime rate . However , in order to tackle this problem more effectively , governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children ‰Ûª s television programs . As a result of mental immaturity , most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong . Little wonder , then , that by watching these violent TV programs and videos , juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes . Therefore , it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies . 	384	2	Nevertheless , it would certainly be a violation of adults ‰Ûª civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences . Frequently , adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day . For whom , such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment . Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors , they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them . 	385	1	On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . 	insufficient385	2	On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . 	insufficient386	1	To begin with , the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children . In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same . From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances . 	insufficient386	2	"To add up , when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none . It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others ; it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents . Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension . "	387	1	Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before . Exhaust from transportation , especially cars , and factories ' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases . Besides , water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical . The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people ' s bodies and create severe problems , which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time . 	387	2	Moreover , it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink . Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today ' s market . Also , overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases , especially cough , sneezing and illness . Furthermore , living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas . Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary , pickpocketing , trickery , vandalism , smuggling or even murder . Earning money for living becomes more difficult , living healthy in such places is getting harder also . 	388	1	First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	388	2	In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	388	3	Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	389	1	In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	389	2	Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . Basic education teaches one child to read and write . Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	390	1	First of all , it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people . We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off . However , the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles . They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them . Therefore , it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills . 	390	2	"Moreover , it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements . We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc . As a result , to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates . Thus , only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters . "	391	1	In the first place , spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills . For example , as people , especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones , they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends , and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills . Moreover , continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children ' s eyesight and physical posture . As a result , it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently . 	391	2	Furthermore , the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development . For instance , there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature . In these games , children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players , and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviors . Consequently , frequent conflicts may occur during communication . 	insufficient391	3	However , we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints . Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience . The reason is that , as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones , people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge . Thus , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	392	1	On one hand , solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems . For example , air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances . However , individuals are unable to cope with these things . 	insufficient392	2	Besides , the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people . It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection . This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society , and the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens . 	392	3	On the other hand , it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment . For instance , many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment . If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement . 	insufficient393	1	It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating . These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings . Consequently , a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes . 	393	2	An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise . This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police . Thus , without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken . 	393	3	Most importantly , particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced . Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions . 	394	1	Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities , handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning . Firstly , this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing . It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well . Under the guidance of parents or teachers , children can benefit from practicing handwriting . This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content , elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities . 	394	2	Secondly , parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance . The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons . It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works . Moreover , the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills . For example , with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word , learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes . 	insufficient395	1	Firstly , by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor . It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course . With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life . 	395	2	"Secondly , the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital . Obviously , this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation ; therefore , the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue . In addition , the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care . "	395	3	Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them . They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use . Nevertheless , we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade . We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes . 	396	1	It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing . Investing in hospitals helps improve people ' s health , also , in schools assists with raising our children ' s education level . Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately , our standard of living would deteriorate . 	396	2	But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts . Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical . These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy . The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K-pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance . 	insufficient397	1	Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets . The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries . However , these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones . For instance , factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products , the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead , new video games has superseded the old-physical ones . Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology . 	insufficient397	2	However , despite the drawback mentioned above , technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways . Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world . With the help of advanced methods , many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved . Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply , hence discovering more cultural traces . 	insufficient398	1	On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality . Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases . For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world . Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts . Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter . This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect . 	398	2	Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development . For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect . 	insufficient398	3	On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects . It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender . 	399	1	The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard . This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living . Further more , they will not value other people ' s hard work and take everything for granted . 	399	2	Meanwhile , not all celebrities are role models . It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols , having messy sex lives . Worse still , without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living . 	399	3	Of course , some celebrities , e . g . writers , passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world . 	400	1	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	400	2	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	insufficient401	1	The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage . In my view , the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics . For example , in a traditional Turkish family , while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child , a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child . 	insufficient401	2	The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today . In my opinion , we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships . For instance , a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today ' s society . Instead , all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals . Therefore , I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity . 	insufficient402	1	On the other hand , studying hard will give children a better future . Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future . Naturally , children will be growing up and looking for their job . For instance , children who always studying hard and getting high achievement , it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company . If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary . The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results . 	402	2	At the same time , playing sports will give good effects on children . There are many popular sports among children such as football , basketball , and volleyball . Also , there are many benefit when children doing sport . Firstly , children who always playing sport like football , they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player . It will be good for children , because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team . That will make children getting lots of friends , so they can contribute positively to community . Secondly , playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children ' s well-being .
