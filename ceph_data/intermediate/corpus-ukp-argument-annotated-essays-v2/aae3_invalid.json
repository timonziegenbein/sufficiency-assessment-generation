With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative. First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create. Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things. Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.

Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender. Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission.  However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender. To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career.

If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying. Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice.

Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school. First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned. Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future.

Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both.

There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?", "para_text": " Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece. First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists. Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely. Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts. To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.

Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?", "para_text": " Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace. Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized. Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers. Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime. To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.

The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine. In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.

Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge. Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity.  Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss. In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages.

A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.", "para_text": " Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding. When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents.  Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school.  Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve. The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.", "premises": ["This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos"], "conclusion": "in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities", "au": "NA", "major_claim": "zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding", "removal_reason": "NA"}, {"index": "essay180_1", "topic": "Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives.

Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life.

Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money.  Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.

However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship. The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment. The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department.  Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office.

Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities. Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities. Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money. In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town.

What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?", "para_text": " These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this. To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time.  However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution. In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.", "premises": ["these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials"], "conclusion": "young people tend to study or work in urban areas", "au": "NA", "major_claim": "I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment", "removal_reason": "NA"}, {"index": "essay214", "topic": "Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.", "para_text": " Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health. First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health. Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences.  Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader.  To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.

Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects.  In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress. In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.", "premises": ["it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children", "if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects"], "conclusion": "the television can have violent programs", "au": "NA", "major_claim": "television has more positive effects than negative effects", "removal_reason": "NA"}, {"index": "essay231", "topic": "It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city.

My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do. I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university.

Because of that, they don\u2019t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch. Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.", "para_text": " Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons. Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship. In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms. Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world. In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.", "premises": ["they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life"], "conclusion": "cars cause a lot of pollution", "au": "NA", "major_claim": "cars have improved modern life", "removal_reason": "NA"}, {"index": "essay257", "topic": "\"When people succeed, it is because of hard work.

Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here.  To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me. Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam. Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work.

In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study. First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played.  In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life.

Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.

Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers. To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance. Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students. Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life. In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance.

As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself.  Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher.  Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened. Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.", "premises": ["for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising", "if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment"], "conclusion": "being without a teacher has shortcomings", "au": "NA", "major_claim": "I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself", "removal_reason": "NA"}, {"index": "essay298", "topic": "In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.", "para_text": " When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons. The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things. Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially. In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students.

Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course. Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes.

As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages.  On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students.  On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation.

That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions.  To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly. Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen.  At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.

However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life.

Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint.  Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture.  Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful.  Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle.  Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance.

Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.", "para_text": " As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time. Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income. Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents. While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs.  In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.", "premises": ["It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs"], "conclusion": "young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own", "au": "NA", "major_claim": "young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time", "removal_reason": "NA"}, {"index": "essay342", "topic": "Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged.

However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments. A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project. On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things. In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work.

Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged. However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well.

The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably.

Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons. Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture. Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment. Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts.  To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society.
